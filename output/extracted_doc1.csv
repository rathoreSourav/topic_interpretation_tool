Granite is a company with a strong set of core values and exceptional employees who have the knowledge, experience, integrity, and commitment to build the infrastructure of the future. Background Soon after joining Granite Construction in May 2011 as the SVP of Human Resources, Phil DeCocco incorporated the Caliper Profile into the Granite Construction employee selection process. He later hired Renee Gallegos to serve as Granite VP of Training and Organizational Development. Like Phil, Renee had experience in using the Caliper Profile, as the assessment was utilized at her former employer. The Business Challenge At Granite Construction, Renee was primarily using the Caliper Profile as an instrument to aid her in employee development. She was looking for the best way to easily access information on internal employees for coaching purposes, for high-potential employee (Hi-Po) identification, and for succession management initiatives. Moreover, she was seeking a tool that could offer an additional perspective on an individual that a standard Three Sixty assessment could not provide. The Strategic Solution Renee partnered with Caliper to implement the Caliper Three Sixty Plus instrument. The Three Sixty Plus combines an Caliper Profile results with performance feedback from employees, and the resulting report provides information on strengths, developmental areas, and perceptions from peers. This tool provided her with the personality component and innate behavioral tendencies of her learners, which was the valuable data she had been hoping to find. With the information gleaned from the Caliper Three Sixty Plus instrument, she was able to better understand why 360 raters might be grading a learner a particular way. The Results With these additional insights into their performance and potential, Granite Construction was better equipped to identify high-potentials and offer targeted coaching to maximize the productivity of their workforce. Renee describes how the Caliper Three Sixty Plus contributed to successful coaching at Granite Construction: an example, I was coaching an employee who received several comments about not being an assertive leader. As it turns out, the employee had high aggressive and assertive scores but also had a really high accommodation score. The employee wanted to be more assertive but was dealing with an internal conflict between balancing their assertiveness and their need to accommodate. If I seen the Caliper results, along with the feedback, it might have taken several sessions, or I may never have discovered the root cause of the issue, which would have led to less effective Related Resources How Leaders Grow: A Framework For Action If you go to the business section of any major book store, you will find dozens of books claiming to contain the for how to be a great leader.

In addition, coaching reports are available to help build a stronger rapport between the manager and employee to foster stronger teams. Mental Toughness for Sales For the past two decades, Caliper has been exploring mental toughness , a personality trait that has historically been associated with professional athletes. Through our research we found that the same traits that was being found in professional athletes could also be found in top performing sales professionals . In our recent whitepaper we have defined the six key traits that compose of mental toughness. Level-headedness Level-headedness is all about the ability to control your emotions, especially in high-stress situations. This is essential to the success in any sales scenario, but how do you know if your sales team members have it? When they enter a tough scenario, they come out on the other side composed, strong, and continuing to work toward solving the issues at hand. Not everyone will have total control over their emotions, but it can be developed through effective coaching . By showing your sales team how remaining calm in stressful situations can benefit their career growth, they will work on creating good habits and techniques that allow them to stabilize their emotions Stress-tolerance All employees experience stress at some point in their career; it is inevitable as things get busy. But, those who can push through it, focus on the current sale, and stay positive, will close more deals. These three things will help your team maintain a higher level of tolerance when it comes to stress: 1) look at the positives, 2) coach by example, and 3) look at the opportunities. By coaching your employees , you will help them manage their stress levels, and, through practice, they will build the endurance needed to deal with negative pressures. Resiliency/Ego-strength Emotional resilience makes you more adaptable in places of change and able to bounce back from setbacks. It will help you pivot from one deal to the next, managing your workload better and strengthening long-term relationships. To improve resiliency, employees need to feel secure in their role. A great way to do that is through skills training and by giving them a platform to share their ideas. By offering them a way to improve their communication tactics, technical skills, or soft skills, they will feel more confident and supported by the company. Energy/Persistence Energy/persistence is a measure of potential to sustain a high level of activity over extended periods. High scores relate to being active and persistent in overcoming obstacles. Those with lower scores tend to be less energetic with respect to tasks and may not always persist when necessary to achieve a goal. Persistence fuels your sales team to meet goals even when stress is high or motivation is low. It is a key to selling to the best of abilities regardless of negative situational factors. The best way to help your sales team stay persistent is by setting clear goals and measuring milestones. Self-structure Self-structure means a measure of preference for independently determining work methods. A high score indicates the motivation to work independently. A low score indicates one is unlikely to define own work habits and methods. Many sales professionals lack self-structure and struggle with time management and organizational skills. They could be failing to set goals for themselves or making strategic decisions, but with some project management coaching, they will become self-starters and ready for anything. Teach them how to create priority task lists, manage deadlines, and how to apply valuable organizational skills to their workload. Thoroughness To be thorough means being detail and process-oriented from start to finish without cutting corners or sacrificing quality for the sake of time. The best way to help employees develop this trait is by coaching prioritization and communicating the importance of each task. Another key factor in thoroughness is consistency and reliability, so demonstrate that it is important to make these things a part of their routine so that thoroughness becomes a standard byproduct of their process. Prioritize major tasks and coach them on how to rank the importance of each part as it relates to the whole. This will help your employees understand which tasks need particular care and how the quality of each piece can affect the greater project.

The Canada-Ontario Job Grant provides direct financial support to individual employers or employer consortia who wish to purchase training for their employees. It is available to small, medium and large businesses with a plan to deliver short-term training to existing and new employees. Important to know: Employers can get up to $10,000 in government support per person for training costs. The training has to be delivered by an eligible, third-party trainer. Employers with 100 or more employees need to contribute 1/2 of the training costs. Small employers with less than 100 employees need to contribute 1/6 of training costs. For employer groups who want to apply for training supports the government offers a COJG Consortium Stream. The Consortium Stream allows a group of employers (two or more employers) to pool their resources to support common training objectives and goals. To apply as a consortium, the intermediary organization needs to ensure all the participating employers and trainees meet COJG requirements, and are able to make their required contribution towards the training cost.

As employees who have held their positions for several years begin to retire, the options for replacement are limited to a candidate pool full of younger individuals with limited experience. This is a huge concern due to the safety requirements of certain positions. Take Your Safe Behaviour To Work CREATING A SAFETY FIRST CULTURE The solution to mitigating risk and reducing the number of workplace accidents is to ensure a culture. This safety first culture must be adopted into all aspects and divisions of an organization, however, it needs to be most heavily integrated into the hiring process. By using behavioural assessments, companies are able to identify candidates who are more inclined to make riskier decisions and act unsafe on the job. These types of behaviours are directly correlated to workplace injuries and accidents. By weeding out the individuals who are most likely to make risky decisions, the culture can begin to form. With behavioural assessments, companies are able to identify the ideal candidates who are more likely to follow the rules and guidelines provided to them and be a part of the culture.
