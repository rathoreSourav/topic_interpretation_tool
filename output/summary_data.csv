Based on experiences in a large number of professional selections of candidates for employment, relying on a scientific approach and the findings of multiple data analyses, an instrument was constructed that, through a small number of statements (61), captures a number of highly relevant features within the professional and organizational environment.
In other words, it is often important to us, for a number of different work positions, to know in which terms we could describe the thoroughness or perseverance of an individual, their ability to control impulses, their level of readiness to involve themselves in various work activities, initiative in work, tendency to establish and maintain contact with colleagues and the like.
Through years of work and research, psychologists have included these features in the Working Values Questionnaire, which, as a simple and comprehensive instrument, has proven to be applicable both in situations of evaluating candidates for lower and middle positions, as well as when evaluating leading personnel.
Although the Working Values Questionnaire in most cases in the organizational context represents an adequate measure for an personality, offering some of the most important information, in certain situations it is useful to assess some additional traits as well.
In addition to the other instruments, the assessment of candidates in higher positions can be supplemented with a longer version of the Working Values Questionnaire (WVQL or WVQL+), which also provide a more detailed picture of the person.
Considering this, the simplicity of its application and the value of the information it provides make it an instrument of interest in situations that require an assessment of stress at work.
Due to its adequate reliability and validity, it is a useful and appropriate instrument for situations in which an assessment of emotional intelligence is required, and the practicality of the application itself is a priority.
