Anthology allows YOU to designate the purpose of the cymbal and explore new terrain to play your way. An innovation that underscores instinct over orders, and creativity over categorization. Anthology is a return to essence. A re-orientation towards new possibilities and thinking. An instrument that transcends labels and inspires individual expression. Jojo mayer BREAKING THE MOLD Fast Response The player stays in control. When riding the cymbal, stick definition never gets lost or washed out by the spread of the cymbal. Quick accents to the cymbal open up and immediately return. The crashing properties range from sensitive rolls with fingertips or mallets, to explosive crashes that will punch through the loudest musical passages. The bell tones are balanced and clear at all dynamic levels. The Sound Warm, vintage tones spiced up to serve today's music. The feel Buttery feel and looseness that is traditionally only found in thinner cymbals comes with the projection of heavier weights. The Weights Each cymbal's specific weight is measured and inscribed inside the bell by the cymbal smith. The Look The philosophy of transcending labels is reflected with minimized branding and logos on all Anthology cymbals HHX ANTHOLOGY IN ACTION Watch & Explore Anthology With Jojo Mayer the RANGE OF SOUND Breakthrough manufacturing techniques in lathing and hammering expand the sonic range of Anthology beyond common cymbals. WEIGHT * Anthology cymbals are carefully hand crafted with variations in weight creating an instrument as unique as the player.

JOJO Demo Video LOW BELL 14"" High Bell 14"" LOW BELL High BELL LOW BELL High BELL Bell Height Comparison 22"" Bell Comparison 18"" Bell Comparison 14"" Bell Comparison Anthology is a bridge between tradition and innovation. These cymbals cover all genres making them the only set of cymbals need for any gig. The Low Bell Hi-Hats for me are pure magic! STEVE HASS John Scofield, Patti Austin The High tone is full and even with no harsh spikes in frequency. With a little exploration found so much utility and tone! Karah James Valley You can definitely put them on the drumset and you're ready to go. The critical frequencies are so balanced, especially the mid ones that the ride/crash combo is totally where without losing the purpose of crashing or riding in just one unique cymbal. Bruno Valverde Smith/Kotzen, Angra My band couldn't believe that I was only working one cymbal, the 22"" Low Bell. Pulling all these sounds out of one instrument is something extremely special. Josiah Maddox The anthology series immediately triggered my inspiration. The crispness in the hats and the immediate cutting response when choking the hats made me wanna play it all day long. Especially the 22""s have been types of cymbals I've been searching for a lifetime: A nice warm crashing sound, not too high frequencies, and still have a clear bell sound (even the low bell one). Baard Kolstad Leprous The 22"" High Bell is one of - if not my favorite - cymbal that I've played, like, ever. I really really love that 22"" cymbal. And they work really well with different SABIAN series.

Traditionally, marching ensembles have struggled to have mini-hats heard on the field the XSR Mini-hats solve that problem: these mini-hats produce clarity while projecting through any size ensemble. ensembles have struggled for years to find mini-hats that sound amazing but have a manageable weight for the player. I reached out to a number of our top educators to help us solve this says Mark Reynolds, National Director of Sales School Music Division, adding further, Love has made these XSR Mini-Hats with a medium-heavy bottom and a slightly lighter top which means they have clarity, amazing articulation, and can cut over the top of a marching ensemble, whether on the field or More than any other cymbal brand, SABIAN has always met the needs of the marching and education community, offering an unmatched array of sounds across all price points.

Our third Vault Drop was first introduced as an entrant in our 2013 Cymbal Vote program. While not the winner that year, it was close, and ever since been receiving requests from drummers all over the map, so dusting them off for a Vault Drop, made perfect sense. decrease quantity by 1 HHX Compression Hats quantity increase quantity by 1 Add to cart Go to HHX series toggle in page nav items Overview Reviews Find Stores At a glance This pairing is a combination of an un-lathed, aggressively hammered medium weight top, with 5 one-inch air holes. The bottom is fully lathed and heavy, with our Aero hole design. The holes in both the top and bottom result in a loud foot chick, with a trashy slap effect. Overall, the sound has a metallic/industrial type attack, and a trashy sizzle effect when played slightly open. Definitely a progressive sounding pair of hi hats.

It has been in pain for years. Maybe we thought that the problems were So much violence. It is never the right answer to lead with violence. Are we the most intelligent animal on the planet? Why would we not act that way? Violence is the easy answer. The truth is violence creates problems. Violence solves no problems. Nobody wants to visit violence upon themselves, why would we bring it upon others when there are better options? Every religion, every positive philosophy, and teaching stress this: Treat people with respect and value. We want everyone to treat us with fairness and equality. Why not do the same for all our human brothers and sisters? The moment we treat anyone differently based upon anything other than their actions, we mistreat ourselves and degrade our civilization. We all matter. why Sabian proudly declares black lives matter.

The evolved KROSS 2 expands polyphony from 80 to 120 voices, and dramatically powers-up the number of internal programs from 809 to 1,075 programs. Including multi-layered pianos and electric pianos, thick strings and other new sounds that will work well with any band, as well as the latest drum kits to cover current styles such as EDM. The wide selection of programs covers your needs from live performance to studio production. Built-in expansion PCM memory, and support for optional libraries The KROSS 2 now provides 128 MB of built-in expansion PCM memory. By selecting from optional libraries that will be released following KROSS 2, you can expand KROSS internal sounds to meet the needs of your performing style or situation. The rich expressive power of the EDS-i sound engine, with a full complement of effects The high-quality EDS-i Enhanced Definition Synthesis-integrated sound engine is inherited from professional synthesizers. You can use a total of seven effects units simultaneously: five insert and two master. Rich expressive power is available from the selection of 134 high-quality effects, including standard effects such as delay and reverb as well as amp modeling, vintage effect units, and even a vocoder. Superb sampling function and a pad sampler As a first in its class, the KROSS 2 is newly equipped with a unique sampling function that provides 16 playable pads. You can record the input from the LINE IN jack and assign a stereo sample of up to 14 seconds to each pad. Up to four pads can be triggered simultaneously. You can edit the sample waveform using functions such as start/end loop point settings and normalize, and even resample within the KROSS 2, allowing you to perform extensive sampling without requiring any additional equipment. Long audio files from an SD card can also be assigned to these pads. Straightforward access to the sounds and functions you need It's easy to get around on KROSS 2, thanks to a user-friendly layout. The panel of the KROSS 2 has been further improved since the first KROSS, ensuring that anyone can quickly access desired sounds and functions from the enormous range of choices. Realtime control section The new realtime control section lets you directly control KROSS main parameters without having to navigate through a menu hierarchy. In addition to realtime control of the sounds and effects, and simple editing of programs, you can use the knobs to easily control the vocoder settings or adjust the tempo of the arpeggiator and sequencer. Favorites function The favorite function lets you register frequently-used programs and combinations and recall them at a single touch, and has even been expanded to allow 128 favorite locations, twice the number of the first generation of KROSS. This function is ideal for live players that need quick access to a specialized set of sounds on stage. Quick layer/split The layer/split function, which lets you layer two sounds or assign separate sounds to the left and right regions of the keyboard, is now easier to set up, thanks to a dedicated quick layer/split button. Category dial A category dial is provided, allowing you to immediately find the sounds you're looking for amid the vast range of choices. Just choose the general type of sound, such as piano or organ, and then make your selection quickly and efficiently. Ultra-lightweight and compact body, with support for battery operation KROSS 2-88 - The battery case The amazing mobility of the KROSS series is better than ever. The 61-key model features a new and stylish design, and its weight has been further reduced from the 4.3 kg of the previous model to an even more lightweight 3.8 kg. Additional improvements in power efficiency allow up to seven hours of battery-powered operation from six AA batteries. The 88-key model newly provides an accessory compartment that can hold spare batteries or cables, as well as an easily accessible front-located battery panel. On both models, the rear panel KORG logo is fully illuminated, letting you stand out on stage. The ultimate body finish that exceeds its class The evolved KROSS 2 also features high quality in its body finish. First, KROSS 2 uses a matte color with a high-quality rubberized finish that is durable and feels great to the touch. Lavish use of this sophisticated rubberized finish gives the instrument a highly professional appearance. KROSS 2-88-MB (Super Matte Black) KROSS 2-61-MB (Super Matte Black) Audio player/recorder that you can easily trigger from the pads The built-in stereo audio recorder lets you record your KROSS 2 performance, or overdub an external input source such as vocals.

The Evolution of a Modern Classic Never before has a single instrument captured the signature sound, the unique performance experience, and the aesthetic satisfaction of so many definitive keyboards as the KORG SV-2 Stage Vintage. Ten years ago, KORG launched the Stage Vintage line to wild acclaim. The combination of an intuitive live panel, the premier keybed, the ultimate realization of coveted vintage sounds, the clarity of world-class pianos, the warmth and character of period-proper effects, and the distinctively smooth shape has inspired musicians from around the globe for over a decade. Available with either 88 keys or 73 keys, these SV-2 models are the latest additions to the Stage Vintage series, featuring more of everything that makes an SV great. More Sounds. More Memory. More Polyphony. More Presets. More Control. It is quite literally everything one could want in a performance stage piano and more. Plus, be sure to check out the SV-2S models, equipped with an internal K-ARRAY speaker system. SV-2 - Introduction Movie Click here for YouTube video featuring SV-2 More. More. More. SV-2S 73 The SV-2 contains over ten times the sample data available in previous SV models, providing ample memory for many all-new piano and keyboard sounds. The SV-2 is home to 72 compelling sounds, and provides 64 memory locations to store edited Favorites for instant access during performance. Using the SV-2 Editor software, users are now free to create their own split and layered programs and save them to one of the Favorites locations. In fact, a single favorite can access up to three timbres at once A piano/bass split with a layer of strings, for example. While user splits must be created using the SV-2 Editor, the split point on the keyboard can be adjusted directly from the front panel. Plus, polyphony of the SV-2 now stands at 128 voices, allowing more effective layering of sounds or sustained chording. Faithful Sound Reproduction SV-2 88 The SV-2 represents the pinnacle of audio sampling techniques and careful instrument preparation, delivering the most exacting and accurate rendition of so many keyboard classics. Using only the best-maintained instruments and the latest methods, every sound has been captured as precisely as possible. The slap of the tine, the release of the hammer, the click of the element is amazingly preserved in the RX Layer; mix in as much or as little of these authentic artifacts as you need. In addition, the full dynamic range of each instrument has been faithfully preserved, recreating all of the timbral and volume changes generated from a ppp (pianississimo) touch to an fff (fortississimo) strike and everything in between. This detailed sampling regime creates a three-dimensional sense of presence, allowing the sound to fully occupy its place in the mix or in the performance space. Coveted Classics Experience a treasure trove of classic electro-mechanical, transistorized, tape-driven, analog, and digital keyboard instruments, all reproduced with stunning realism. These sounds defined decades of popular music, and are now once again in demand. The SV-2 places all of these sought-after sounds right at the fingertips in perfect tune and in impeccable playing condition no maintenance required. all here. Electric pianos now include nearly all the American tine and reed models, a Japanese electric grand, as well as a rare German electric piano. And then there all those clavis, created using a range of settings. Prefer electronic pianos? There are analog, digital, VPM, FM, and sampled versions including the ever-popular KORG M1 piano. Looking for Organs? Select from tone-wheel classics; VOX combo, Italian transistor, or American tube organs; and now church and cathedral organs. Need some strings? Choose from a 70s-era analog string machine, prog-era tape strings, or a warm orchestral section. Plus, the SV-2 contains mallets, brass and choir sounds, guitar and bass sounds, even solo and pad synths that are ideal for layering or creating convenient splits. Plenty of Pianos The SV-2 remains, at heart, a stage piano. At the touch of a button, you can summon the most outstanding grand piano sounds from around the world including exemplary pianos from the leading German, Italian, Austrian, and Japanese instrument makers. For a more intimate setting, choose one of the authentic Japanese or German upright pianos. Also included are a real honky-tonk piano and a genuine piano. Last but not least, the SV-2 contains two gorgeous harpsichords, one French and one Italian. Featured alone, layered with another sound, or split across the keyboard, these outstanding piano sounds deliver a strong foundation while delivering additional performance options. SV-2S 73 Seize Control SV-2 88 The SV-2 invites you to take command of your sound. There is no LCD screen, no menus to dive through. Instantly inviting and familiar, the front panel is always live, so go ahead grab a knob, rotate it, tweak it, and experiment. Change your mind? Pressing in on the knob quickly restores it to the programmed value. Switches with LED indicators show which effects are active, transposition, and more. Sounds are selected through a pair of rotary switches. Eight illuminated buttons in the center of the panel can quickly recall any of 64 Favorite presets, each containing your own customized sounds and settings. Best of all, the SV-2 now offers a Panel Lock function that prevents the accidental switching of sounds if the Favorites buttons are inadvertently touched while performing and also prevents curious fingers from switching settings between sets. More detailed and convenient control is offered via the free SV-2 Editor software. Agility and Expression SV-2S 73 All SV-2 Stage Vintage instruments share the finest KORG RH3 graded-hammer action keybed. As on a grand piano, the weighting of the keys is graduated across the keyboard; heavier in the lower registers and becoming lighter in the upper registers. This RH3 keybed is remarkably sensitive to the nuances of every performance, accurately delivering every expressive element. Selecting one of the eight distinct velocity curves allow the keyboard response to match any playing technique of performance style. Authentic to the end, the SV-2 offers eight tuning schemes including equal, grand piano stretch, electric piano stretch, electric grand, upright stretch, detuned and two user-definable types (configurable using the free SV-2 Editor). The overall tuning, or concert pitch, of the SV-2 can be adjusted to match another instrument or a previously recorded track. Needless to say, the SV-2 can be transposed into any key. Making it Real Adding the right effects provides layers of sonic splendor and adds a crowning level of authority to any vintage keyboard sound. The SV-2 features six independent stages of studio-grade signal processing, highlighted by the KORG Valve Reactor. This Valve Reactor circuit delivers the added warmth or snarl that only a true 12AX7A vacuum tube can provide. As with the sounds themselves, all of the effect models are faithful to the originals and are designed to match the performance, limitations, and behavior of the chosen effect. Effect stages include: - 3-BAND EQUALIZER (Bass, Middle and Treble) - PRE FX (Red Compressor, Treble Boost, U-Vibe, Vibrato, Tremolo, VOX Wah) - AMP MODEL (Clean, Twin, Tweed, AC30, Boutique, Organ, plus several types of Cabinet Simulators and Noise Reduction) - MODULATION FX (Classic Chorus, Black Chorus, Orange Phaser, Small Phaser, MX Flanger, Rotary) - REVERB/DELAY (Room, Plate, Hall, Spring, Tape Echo and Stereo Delay) - TOTAL FX (Stereo Mastering Limiter, Stereo Limiter) Easy to use and simple to control, these period-accurate effects and amp models add authenticity to your vintage and modern sonic pursuits. Modern Connections The SV-2 is host to all the audio jacks, data connections, and pedal ports that professional stage pianos require. In addition to the Left and Right 1/4"" audio outputs, there are Left and Right XLR outputs for connecting directly to a studio console or onstage snake, without requiring any direct boxes or impedance matching transformers. The headphone output allows for onstage monitoring or for rehearsing in private. Din-style MIDI IN and MIDI Out jacks connect easily to other MIDI instruments and music equipment; the USB port provides a data link between the SV-2 and a computer. There are 3 pedal connections: Damper, Pedal 1, and Pedal 2. The DS-2H Damper pedal is included and responds to half-pedaling for an authentic piano response. Pedal 1 is designed for a switch type of pedal and can operate as a piano Sostenuto pedal, or as a Fast/Slow switch when the Rotary Pro effect is on. Pedal 2 can accept either a sweep-type pedal great for authentic Wah effects and accurate organ volume control or an additional switch pedal, providing the piano purist with access to all three piano pedal functions by adding the Una Chorda (soft) function. SV-2 88 SV-2S with internal speaker system SV-2S 88 Enjoy the sound, looks, and performance of the KORG SV-2 everywhere you go. KORG has worked with Italian speaker designers K-ARRAY to create the amazing SV-2S. In addition to every feature found in the SV-2, the SV-2S also includes a built-in speaker system. From the backstage dressing room to the dorm or bedroom; from the musical, stage, or dance rehearsal to choir rehearsal; from the living room to the concert hall or house of worship; the SV-2S is ready to perform, wherever and whenever you are. Producing 15 watts of power (x 2; Left and Right), the internal system features two 2.5"" loudspeakers, plus a 3"" passive radiator. Available with 73 or 88 keys, the SV-2 is finished with an exclusive warm ivory finish contrasting metal grille. Free SV-2 Editor Despite the wealth of on-board SV-2 features, the SV-2 Editor provides a convenient and detailed pathway to editing, organizing, cataloging, and storing edited sounds as Favorites for the SV-2. In addition, the SV-2 Editor offers access to hundreds of other sounds that are not immediately available from the control panel. The SV-2 Editor also makes it easy to set up customized split and/or layered Favorites and save them into memory. Additional SV-2 libraries released by KORG can be loaded using the SV-2 Editor to renew your personal sound catalog. Also, you are free to exchange sounds with other fellow users.

G1 Air / G1 - Introduction Video Korg G1 Air: With Unparalleled Sound And An Expressive Playing Experience Click here for YouTube videos featuring KORG G1 Air. The sound of three of the finest concert grand pianos Multiple-layer samples for ultimate realism Digital recreation of grand piano string and damper resonance for ultimate realism RH3 keyboard accurately simulates acoustic piano touch and response Newly developed amplification and speaker system Contemporary design cabinet available in 3 color options Bluetooth audio playback Made in Japan - Premium Japanese Quality The sound of three of the finest concert grand pianos At the heart of the KORG G1 are 3 world-famous concert pianos, each with its own unique character. No one manufacturer can make a piano that meets the needs of every pianist, and so KORG has selected three renowned instruments from manufacturers in Germany, Austria and Japan. You can now experience the sound of three completely different grand pianos in your own home and select the one that you prefer for a particular piece of music. The German Piano Probably the most famous piano in the world and the choice of numerous pianists and concert venues for many years. Characterized by brilliant highs and rounded bass, the German piano is one of richness and power. The Austrian Piano An instrument with a rich heritage, the Austrian piano offers a warm but brilliantly colorful sound. The Japanese Piano The Japanese piano is characterized by its dynamic sound and is frequently used for a wide range of music genres, from classical to jazz and pop. G1 Air BK Multiple Sound Samples for Outstanding Realism In order to achieve a sound that is as close as possible to that of an acoustic instrument, the three main pianos in the G1 analyze performances dynamics to seamlessly select between different sets of piano samples. From a delicate pianissimo to a powerful fortissimo, the expression is realistically reflected in the sound. Damper Resonance The three concert grand pianos in the G1 realistically recreate the ""damper resonance"" effect that is produced by the sympathetic resonance of the strings in an acoustic piano when the damper pedal is held down (features on the GP1/2, AP1/2, and JP1/2). String Resonance On an acoustic piano, strings will resonate in sympathy as notes of corresponding pitches are played when the damper is lifted. String Resonance is an essential characteristic of the overall sound of an acoustic piano and so the Resonance technology developed for the KRONOS piano sound engine features in the three concert grand pianos in the G1. Key-off Simulation Key-off simulation recreates the sounds that are produced when the fingers lift off the keys. G1 Air BR Bluetooth audio support Connect a Bluetooth device such as a smartphone to the G1 Air and enjoy playing the piano along with your stored music or other audio. When not playing the piano, you can use the G1 Air as a powerful Bluetooth speaker system. Sophisticated and elegant design, with a back panel provided on the latest model. While paying homage to the acoustic traditional form, a new design philosophy elevates the G1 above the bland, rectangular appearance of many digital pianos. The back panel added in the latest model enhances the sense of quality and the overall rigidity of the unit, and also provides privacy from the front. The contemporary design features distinctive softly curved legs which accentuate the overall styling of the instrument and, at only 29 cm (11.42"")* in depth, the G1 can be placed virtually anywhere. The keyboard is protected by a soft-fall key cover that forms a full-width music rest when opened, while your sheet music is held in position by a shaped retaining channel. The G1 is available in black, white or brown to match the of your room. (*Excluding the anti-tip hardware) RH3 keyboard provides a great-feeling playing experience The G1 features the real weighted hammer action 3 (RH3) keyboard which accurately simulates the playing experience of a grand piano, with a heavier playing feel in the lower register that becomes lighter as you move up the keyboard. It is extremely responsive, even when notes are repeated quickly, while the expressive dynamics are faithfully interpreted even in the most complex passages. Key touch control is also provided, with a choice of five levels of sensitivity (light, normal, heavy, stable, fixed) to specify how your playing dynamics are reflected by the sound produced. RH3 - Premium Japan Quality G1 Air WH New speaker system delivers high output and great sounding like a grand piano A custom-designed speaker system recreates the incredibly realistic sound field of the G1 acoustic pianos and other instrument voices. With two large-diameter speakers placed below the keyboard in a resonant enclosure, the full dynamic range of sound is conveyed directly to the player, while high-frequency tones are presented by a pair of speakers mounted above the keyboard. In conjunction with resonances from the cabinet, these provide a rich piano tone, reflecting off the key cover and delivering indirect acoustics similar to those of a traditional instrument. The amplifier section provides 20W of output power for each of the four speakers, delivering up to 80W of sound of the highest quality. From rich bass to brilliant highs, you will experience the nuanced, expressive power of the grand piano in your own home. Enjoy 32 high-quality instruments sounds and studio effects In addition to the three concert grand piano sounds, the G1 also offers electric piano sounds, organ, clavi, vibraphone, acoustic guitar, strings and more, giving you 32 richly expressive sounds. Three high-quality effects are also available: brilliance, reverb, and chorus. Optimal effects are preset for each of the built-in sounds, so all you need to do is select a sound and enjoy playing immediately with the ideal settings.

The damper and soft pedals also feature half-pedaling for even more detailed expression.

Play piano with your right hand and bass with your left to instantly enjoy jazz performance styles. By pressing two of the tone buttons simultaneously, you can easily layer two sounds together. For example, layer piano and strings to play with a rich piano and orchestra combination. also a partner mode that enables you to divide the piano keyboard into two identical sections on left and right, each with their own damper pedal. This is a great way for teacher and pupil to play duets or copy and practise during lessons. Forty piano songs with helpful features for practicing In addition to ten demonstration songs that showcase the different sounds of the G1, there are also 40 built-in piano songs. To help you learn, you can control the tempo, playback the right-hand and left-hand parts separately, and use A-B repeat to practice more complex sections. Two-track song recorder to instantly record your performance Two-track digital recording is instantly available to help you analyze or archive your performances. You can record each hand separately or record an additional track onto a previously-recorded song. Playback tempo can be adjusted and up to 99 user songs can be saved in the instrument.

With its high-quality keybed developed by KORG and a rich variety of 30 sounds that will shine on stage, this instrument is the perfect fit for daily practice or performance Stand out on any stage with the D1 in an elegant white. The super-slim, great-sounding D1 stage piano is now available in both the original black, and a new white color variation. Loaded with 30 sounds and complete with a pedal and music rest, the D1 in either color is a fantastically streamlined stage piano that combines great feel, sound, and portability. D1 - Introduction Video Click here for YouTube videos featuring D1 Japanese-made high-quality RH3 keybed. A compact body that you can take anywhere. Thirty high-quality sounds. Cutting-edge technology faithfully reproduces the resonances of a grand piano. Convenient functions that you expect from a digital piano. In addition to standard-sized LINE OUT jacks, MIDI IN/OUT connectors are also provided. Music rest and dedicated pedal for stage play also included. Japanese-made high-quality RH3 keybed The D1 features a real weighted hammer action 3 (RH3) keybed that reproduces the touch of a grand piano, where the low notes are heavier and the action becomes lighter as you play toward the higher notes. With this keybed's natural-feeling touch and weight, you'll want to keep playing it forever. A compact body that you can take anywhere The chassis construction has been rethought with a new structure and design that slims the body to a depth of approximately 26 cm* (10.24""), the minimum depth that still allows enjoyable playing. Even though the D1 features a full-fledged weighted keybed, it's highly mobile, and can be carried anywhere in its dedicated SC-D1 soft case (sold separately). The stylish ST-SV1 stand (sold separately) completes a great-looking setup on stage or in your room. *: Without the music rest Thirty high-quality sounds The D1 contains a total of 30 richly expressive sounds which include not only a variety of piano sounds to cover genres such as classical, jazz, and pop, but also electric piano, organ, and clavi sounds that will be useful on stage, and even sounds such as vibraphone, acoustic guitar, and strings. Rich piano sounds geared for realism In order to achieve a playing feel that's amazingly close to that of an acoustic piano, the sound switches between four piano samples depending on the dynamics of your performance. From a delicate touch to dynamic fortissimo, the sound responds realistically to your playing. The overall piano sound is enjoyable to play and delivers an authentic experience. Serious electric piano sounds The electric piano sounds reproduce not only the tonal differences in response to your playing touch but also the key-off noise. Six variations are built in, covering sounds often used in the popular music of the '60s and '70s as well as tones that are treasured in soul music. Organ sounds Six versatile sounds are provided, ranging from sounds used in rock or jazz to solemn pipe organ tones. Cutting-edge technology faithfully reproduces the resonances of a grand piano The D1 features functionality that reproduces the sound of a grand piano, enabling natural-sounding and great-feeling performances. Damper resonance The Concert Piano, Grand Piano and Jazz Piano sounds reproduce damper resonance, realistically simulating the spacious resonance produced by the sympathetic vibration of the strings when you hold down the damper pedal of an acoustic piano. Key-off simulation The D1 also simulates the decay of the sound when you take your finger off a key and the way in which your playing technique affects the string resonance, responding to staccato or legato in a natural way that further enhances the expressiveness of your performance. Convenient functions that you expect from a digital piano The metronome can be turned on/off at a touch. Layer mode lets you layer two sounds simply by pressing two sound buttons simultaneously, for example letting you combine strings or vibraphone with the piano sound that you're playing. The touch control function lets you choose from five settings (light, standard, heavy, stable, fixed) to specify how the sound responds to your playing dynamics, allowing you to enjoy performing with the response of your choice. Three high-quality effects are also built-in: brilliance, reverb, and chorus. The optimal effect for each internal sound is already specified as a preset, so you can simply select a sound and focus on playing it with the best possible tone. Standard-sized LINE OUT jacks, and also MIDI IN/OUT connectors The D1 provides the external connection jacks that you'll need on stage. The standard-sized LINE OUT jacks can be connected directly to amplified speakers or to recording equipment. MIDI IN/OUT connectors are also provided. You can connect these via a MIDI interface to your computer, and use the D1 as a MIDI keyboard or as a piano sound module. Music rest and dedicated pedal for stage play are included The music rest that's indispensable for stage performance is included standard, and can easily be attached to the D1. Also included is a compact-sized damper pedal for convenient portability. ACCESSORIES SEQUENZ SC-D1 A dedicated soft case for the KORG D1. ST-WL A stylish wooden keyboard stand for the D1, SV-2, SV-1. The CONCERT series is a line of pianos that are designed to provide the same performance experience as when listening or playing in a concert hall, in every aspect of sound, touch, and musical experience.

Christophe Anet You may remember from your science classes in school that the speed of sound is a constant, but this statement is entirely dependent on the material through which sound is propagating. Different medium transmit sound at very different speeds. So, look at some typical materials that most people would encounter in indoor live sound Read More Developing Your Contemporary Worship Team Vocals January 17, 2023 by Golden Preciado January 17, 2023 by Golden Preciado Once upon a time, churches had no sound systems. The congregation sang their lyrics and sight read their vocal parts from hymnals. Fast forward to today; most churches are using current technology including sound systems, lighting, presentation software, cameras for live streaming and more. Unlike church from ages past, we must consider how to integrate Read More Setting Subwoofer Level correctly in your PA System December 6, 2022 by Christophe Anet December 6, 2022 by Christophe Anet Subwoofers are great solutions to extend the low frequency performance of your PA system, and there are three aspects to consider carefully when setting up a subwoofer. In the following order. Subwoofer Placement If subwoofers are used in many portable and installed PA applications to enhance the overall listening and performance experience, their placement in Read More What Causes Loudspeaker Hum and Hiss and How to eliminate it November 1, 2022 by Christophe Anet November 1, 2022 by Christophe Anet If you are familiar attending any type of live show, concert or performance using PA loudspeakers, you will most likely also agree that humming, hissing or buzzing noise can quickly ruin a performance. This article reviews each of the common causes of audible (and irritating) hum and hiss, and discusses effective strategies to Read More Understanding Closed, Vented and Band-pass Subwoofer Designs September 27, 2022 by Christophe Anet September 27, 2022 by Christophe Anet The history of the subwoofer is inextricably linked with the evolution of the full-range loudspeaker. In the mid-1950s, various manufacturers of hi-fi loudspeakers began to introduce compact, closed-box enclosures that featured long-throw woofers, and in the early 1970s a talented engineer working at Jensen, named James Novak, developed the equations describing a bass reflex (or Read More What is Auto Mixing on a Digital Mixer? August 30, 2022 by Christophe Anet August 30, 2022 by Christophe Anet An auto mixer, or automatic microphone mixer, is a live sound-mixing tool that automatically reduces the volume level of a audio signal when it is not used. This is particularly valuable when several microphones are open at the same time, reducing extraneous noise. In this article, we will describe how the Auto Mixer function Read More How to correctly position multiple Subwoofers for Cardioid Deployment June 2, 2022 by Christophe Anet June 2, 2022 by Christophe Anet To start, recall that the low frequency energy radiated from a conventional subwoofer is effectively omnidirectional below 200 Hz. This is because the directivity of a subwoofer is related to the ratio of its size to the length of the sound wave it produces. The length, or size, of the sound wave is inversely Read More Practical Tips on Loudspeaker Placement for Live Sound (Part IV) May 9, 2022 by Christophe Anet May 9, 2022 by Christophe Anet Perhaps even more important than horizontal coverage is vertical coverage, where elevation and distance become critical. A large part of proper loudspeaker coverage is finding a balance between loudspeaker distance and volume. To a certain extent, having loudspeakers farther from the audience makes it easier to achieve consistent coverage, assuming you have sufficiently powerful loudspeakers Read More Practical Tips on Loudspeaker Placement for Live Sound (Part III) April 1, 2022 by Christophe Anet April 1, 2022 by Christophe Anet Every venue has its own specific set of coverage challenges. For instance, a club with a low ceiling will never provide enough vertical space to fly a line array system, and in outdoor sound reinforcement, the absence of walls brings its own set of constraints.

Fantasy White Fantasy Black Fantasy Yellow Fantasy Red Fantasy Fire Fantasy blue Metal Black Olive Zebrano Vintage Aluminium Copper Aluminium Dark Fiamma Nero Metal Blue Technology and processes THE SHELL Our shells consist of a structure, with two strong HPL (High Pressure Laminate) layers that have a minimum thickness of 0.8 mm to 0.9mm. The thickness depends on the type of colour and finish. These elements are connected by an internal band made from three alternate one- millimetre wooden layers. This particular structure lends considerable strength and stability to the shell. The rigid, lightweight structure, its perfect point of contact with the drum head (Start Point), together with a new ST (Strong Traction) lug, are key to its extraordinary tuning range. In addition to providing a strong anchor point for the lugs, the internal HPL layer (a material not previously used to make drums) makes the shell waterproof, thus preventing deterioration over time. THE ST LUG The innovative TAMBURO ST Lug strong traction lug thanks to its technical and structural characteristics, allows the one to satisfy any customization needs regarding the depth of the drum, starting from a minimum depth of 3.5 inches. TRIPLE FLANGE HOOP 2.2mm steel. Precise, light they produce muted and well-defined harmonics. THE FLOOR TOM BRACKET Chromed die-cast floor tom Bracket in light alloy with wing nut for a quick, safe set up. The bracket is equipped with an anti-vibration soft rubber gasket. The shape and small size make it easy to position the drum in its case. THE BASS DRUM HOOPS Our hoops are made with an internal and external HPL (High Pressure Laminate) lining, which defines both finish and colour. Twelve layers of internal beech are attached in the same direction, using a special PU glue. This is how a rigid drum hoop with strong mechanical properties is created. Boasting a thickness of just 8 mm. THE BASS DRUM SPURS Thanks to their characteristics our bass drum spurs offer stability and ease when positioning the bass drum. Strong and lightweight, attached to the shell via four anchor points. Our bass drum leg provides the drummer with a customisable, stable position. Tamburo Drums Passione, tanta musica.

Martin & Co. warrants, to the original owner only, factory installed electronics for a period of one year from the date of purchase. Back to Top 02. HOW DO I CLEAN AND POLISH MY GUITAR? To clean your guitar, wipe it down with a clean, damp cotton cloth with water then a dry cotton cloth to dry. For polishing, we recommend using Martin Polish and Cleaner which is available for purchase online and in our 1833 Shop. We recommend this polish for gloss finish guitars but not satin finish. It will not harm satin finish guitars, though after time the finish may begin to shine unevenly. It is best to use just plain water on satin finish guitars. Back to Top 03. CAN I USE LEMON OIL ON MY FINGERBOARD? Martin Guitar does not recommend using lemon oil on the fingerboard. The acids in lemon oil break down the finish of your guitar. It may also speed the corrosion of the frets and decrease the life of your strings. Back to Top 04. I FIND MY TRUSS ROD. WHAT SHOULD I DO? We recommend that your guitar be taken to an authorized Martin service center to have adjustments made. Incorrect adjustments may cause damage and may affect your limited lifetime warranty.

If your guitar does not have a serial number and was manufactured prior to 1898, it may only be identifiable by measurements, appointments and stampings. If that is the case, you can send photos and a description of the instrument here . Back to Top 10. WHERE CAN I FIND THE SERIAL NUMBER OF MY GUITAR? A Martin Guitar will have the model designation and the serial number etched on the neck block. Look in the soundhole toward the neck to see where this is etched. Back to Top 11. WHERE WAS MY GUITAR MADE? Martin guitars are made in Nazareth, Pennsylvania with the exception of the X Series, Backpacker Series, Road Series, Dreadnought Junior, PA5 models, and select ukuleles which are made in our plant in Mexico. Back to Top 12. WHAT IS THE APPRAISED VALUE OF MY GUITAR? Martin Guitar cannot appraise your guitar for you. We recommend contacting an independent appraiser for assistance or referencing the Blue Book of Guitars. Back to Top 13. CONSIDERING BUYING A USED MARTIN GUITAR, CAN YOU HELP? Martin position is not an intermediary between a purchaser and seller to validate or discredit a seller's or purchaser's claim about an instrument. We suggest you contact an independent consultant to verify any used Martin product for sale. Back to Top 14. WHAT IS A MARTIN GOYA GUITAR? The Goya series was imported from Korea and available for sale at an affordable price point from 1980-1993. They came with a one-year warranty to the original owner. Serial numbers and specifications were not kept on the models offered in the Goya series. Back to Top 15. WHAT IS A MARTIN SHENANDOAH GUITAR? The Shenandoah series guitars were considered a mid-range model priced between the Sigma series and higher end Martins. Available from 1983 1993, they were assembled in Nazareth, Pennsylvania from imported parts. Shenandoah series guitars included tortoise-style pickguards and the Martin Thinline pickup as standard features. The models included a lacquer finish with tops made of solid spruce, necks made of mahogany, and the fingerboards and bridges made of rosewood. The back and sides were made from laminates, rosewood, mahogany, or maple. The Shenandoahs came with the limited lifetime warranty to the original, registered owner. You can determine the year your Shenandoah was manufactured by its serial number Back to Top 16. WHAT IS A MARTIN SIGMA GUITAR? The Sigma series was imported from Japan (later from Korea and Taiwan) and available for sale at an affordable price point from 1970 - 2007. All Sigma guitars are constructed with laminated (ply) backs and sides. The Sigma series also included banjos and mandolins also constructed with laminated (ply) backs and sides. Martin Guitar did not keep Sigma serial number records. As such, Sigmas and Mandolins cannot be accurately dated. Back to Top 17.HOW DO I FIND THE SPECIFICATIONS FOR MY PARTICULAR GUITAR? Specifications for each model currently in production can be found on each model page in the Guitars section . Back to Top 18.HOW DO I FIND SPECIFICATIONS FOR A GUITAR NOT ON YOUR WEBSITE? First, try using the search box in the upper right corner of the website. If you still do not find the model you are looking for, that model might be discontinued. You can contact Customer Service to inquire about discontinued model specifications. Back to Top 19.WHAT IS HPL? HPL stands for high pressure laminate. It is a composite material made from paper and resin that is pressed at very high pressure. The surface will have a wood pattern (Mahogany, rosewood, Koa, etc.) and a protective clear coating. It is not a wood veneer. Back to Top 20.WHAT IS BLACK RICHLITE? Black Richlite is a composite material that is made from paper and resin pressed at high pressure. Back to Top 21.WHAT ARE MINERAL DEPOSITS? Mineral deposits are considered a normal characteristic of wood and form as the tree extracts nutrients from the soil. During the finishing process these deposits may appear lighter in appearance. Mineral deposits will not affect the tone or structural integrity of the wood. With our remaining inventory of Brazilian Rosewood diminishing and extremely rare, it is our commitment to utilize the material responsibly, as Martin Guitar presents this exceptional opportunity to our customers. Back to Top 22.WHY ARE GUITARS MADE FROM BRAZILIAN ROSEWOOD SO RARE? Brazilian rosewood is considered nearly extinct and as such is extremely difficult to obtain. It is available in very limited quantities for special limited edition models. Additionally, all rosewood models prior to 1969 were made with Brazilian rosewood, aligning reputation for superior tone closely with the use of this wood. Back to Top 23.WHEN DID EAST INDIAN ROSEWOOD ENTER THE PICTURE? In an effort to attract industry to Brazil in the 1960s, Brazil placed an embargo on Brazilian rosewood logs. In addition to the embargo, Brazilian rosewood logs that were large enough to create two-piece Dreadnought back was quickly becoming depleted. In response, Martin Guitar began using East Indian rosewood from India. Martin Guitar ceased using Brazilian rosewood in standard production for complete sets of back and sides in 1969. Back to Top 24.WHAT DO THE LETTERS AND NUMBERS MEAN IN YOUR MODEL NAMES? Martin basic model designation system begins with a letter or 0 which denotes the body size including 0, 00, 000, 0000, Jumbo, D, Performing Artist, and Grand Jumbo. The following number designates the appointment level. For example, the 15 series includes mahogany, no bindings, and a satin finish. 16, 18, and 28 represent the upgrade to rosewood back and sides. H designates herringbone and scalloped braces. 35, 40, 41, 42 and 45 add represent the addition of pearl. 50 and 100 include highly decorative inlay. The number is also used indicate the price of the instrument. E indicates the model is an acoustic electric. Back to Top 25.WHAT DOES CERTIFIED MEAN? certification ensures that products come from responsibly managed forests that provide environmental, social and economic benefits. The was established in part by the Rainforest Alliance to ensure rigorous standards are met for the protection of forestlands, communities, and wildlife. Certified means that all of the wood components of a guitar meet the stringent requirements of responsible forest management set forth by the Forest Stewardship license code is C008304. Guitars that are Certified are designated by the Certified and Rainforest Alliance seals. These models can be found in the CERTIFIED & SUSTAINABLE WOOD category of our site. Back to Top 26.WHAT DOES SUSTAINABLE WOOD MEAN? Sustainable Wood is a categorization used by Martin to indicate that a guitar model has certified wood components that have been sourced in a responsible manner. Sustainable Wood guitars have Certified parts noted within the specifications. These models can be found in their appropriate categories and in the CERTIFIED & SUSTAINABLE WOOD category on our site. 27.WHAT TYPE OF STRINGS CAME ON MY MARTIN GUITAR? From time to time we changed the type of strings used on new Martin guitars. We are currently stringing most new Martin guitars with Martin SP Lifespan acoustic guitars strings. Martin SP Lifespan strings use an exclusive high-tensile strength core wire to better hold tunings and resist breaking; all six strings are treated with our proprietary treatment to enhance the life of the string. In general, all non-cutaway dreadnoughts and jumbo guitars get medium gauge strings. Most X-series, cutaways, and smaller models such as the OOO and the OO get light gauge strings. Most 12 string guitars get extra light gauge. Guitars designed for nylon strings will be strung with our Martin Classic strings. For the most current information of what type of strings came on your Martin, please refer to the MODEL SPECIFICATIONS for your guitar. Back to Top 28.WHERE CAN I FIND TENSION INFORMATION? Tension varies by gauge and guitar style. However, we include general tension information based on a 25.4"" scale length on EACH STRING PRODUCT PAGE and in OUR CATALOG . Back to Top 29.WHY DO STEEL STRINGS TARNISH? Many of the traditional metals used in acoustic strings are subject to the corrosive effects of oxygen and moisture. Body chemistry can influence the longevity of a string as well; if a player has high acid content in his/her perspiration, strings may tarnish more quickly as well. We recommend always washing hands before playing, wiping down the strings when done, and storing the guitar in its case to increase the longevity of the strings. Back to Top 30.IS IT SAFE TO USE MEDIUM GAUGED STRINGS ON MY SCALLOP BRACED GUITAR? Yes, it is safe. All of our six string guitars designed for steel strings have been tested to withstand the tension of a medium gauge string. However, since each top is unique, take note if the top starts to rise abnormally. If this happens, go back to the lighter gauge strings. Back to Top 31.I KEEP BREAKING STRINGS. HOW CAN I PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING? Your string breakage problem may not be the result of the strings you are using. Strings often break due to an excessively sharp break angle or rough area at the saddle, or a rough area at the nut. Analyze the frequency you break strings and the location of the break, and then discuss with an authorized Martin Warranty Repair Center. If you are a heavy strummer, a medium gauge string may be preferable. Back to Top 32.CAN I JUST CHANGE THE GAUGES OR TYPES OF STRINGS THAT I USE? You can switch easily between types of wrap material, or types of strings - Marquis, SP, SP Flexible Core, etc. If you are changing more than one step in string gauge we recommend that you have the first change done professionally to ensure the set up remains comfortable, intonation accurate, and tone correct. For example, you if normally play lights you should be able to change to a custom light or medium light without issues. However a jump from light to medium or to extra light could affect playability or intonation. Back to Top 33.HOW OFTEN OR WHEN DO I CHANGE STRINGS? Strings usually require changing every few weeks depending upon playing style, desired sound and environmental conditions. As a general rule, when strings require re-tuning often, it is time to change the strings. Changing strings provides a great opportunity to clean and service the guitar, including cleaning and dressing the fret board, polishing or cleaning the top and body, checking the nut and saddle for issues, and possibly changing the battery on a pre-amp if mounted inside the sound hole. Back to Top 34.HOW DO I CHANGE MY STRINGS? String changing does not have to be complicated. Watch our resident expert Dave Doll explain how to change strings on your guitar in our video RESTRINGING YOUR ACOUSTIC GUITAR . Easy to follow, step by step diagrams can also be found in our mobile app, the MARTIN GUITAR TUNER . Back to Top 35.HOW ARE MARTIN STRINGS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER BRANDS? We still make our own strings as we believe strings are important to the sound of the guitar. We put the same care and craftsmanship into the design, sourcing, and manufacturing of the strings as we do our guitars. We set the highest industry standards of quality and design for our SP core wire. All of our metals are sourced to our specifications. We design and build our string winding equipment. And each and every day we test our strings when we string up our guitars in the Martin factory. Back to Top 36.WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 92/8 PHOSPHOR BRONZE AND 80/20 BRONZE? 92/8 Phosphor bronze strings have a higher composition of copper blended into the metal than 80/20 bronze. Generally 80/20 bronze starts out with a bright attack and will mellow quickly while phosphor bronze maintains a warmer more consistent tone and with greater complexity. We generally string Martin Guitars with 92/8 phosphor bronze strings due to the consistency of the strings, however some models will ship with 80/20 bronze. Back to Top 37.WHAT IS A SILK AND STEEL STRING/SILK AND PHOSPHOR STRING? Traditional wound acoustic strings are based on a hex core wire with a single wrap of metal. We start with a round core wire and wrap it first with a soft material. We then wrap the modified core with the silver-plated copper (silk & steel) or 92/8 phosphor bronze (Silk & Phosphor). This process provides a subtle softness to the tone and creates a pleasant-feeling string under the finger. These strings are commonly used in folk and singer/songwriter genres. Back to Top 38.WHY DO YOU OFFER SO MANY GAUGES OF STRINGS? We offer a broad selection of gauges and string types so you can find the best string for your style of play, instrument, and desired tone. In general, lighter gauge strings put less pressure on a top and will produce a lighter softer sound as well as reduce finger fatigue. Light gauges are often chosen by fingerstyle players and singer/songwriters. Heavier gauge strings will drive more energy to the top and therefore create more complex and louder sounds. Bluegrass, rock, and blues players tend to use heavier gauge strings. Our SP Flexible Core strings use a unique construction method to reduce finger fatigue, increase strings response, and maintain equivalent tension on the top as standard sets. SP Flexible Core strings are played by masters like Tommy Emmanuel yet are highly recommended for beginners. Back to Top 39.WHAT IS A MARQUIS STRING? We created our MARQUIS line to pamper your guitar by adding a soft wrap to the area near the ball-ends. This protective layer helps to prevent wear and tear on the bridge and end plate as you play. The added soft layer can also help seat loose bridge pins. Marquis strings put a comforting layer of protection in place every time you change your strings. Back to Top 40.I OWN A MARTIN GUITAR. CAN I STILL USE MARTIN STRINGS? Yes. We have designed our strings such that they will fit on most brands and styles of acoustic guitars. Back to Top 41. Can I register my Martin Ukulele for the warranty? Martin ukuleles are eligible for either a one year or a limited lifetime warranty, depending on the model. You can visit your models product detail page for warranty information, or contact customer service . Back to Top 42. What strings can I put on my Martin ukulele? Martin offers standard and premium Ukulele strings. Check them out here to determine which will work best for you. Back to Top 43. What ukulele body sizes are available? Soprano Ukuleles The first Martin soprano ukes were made in 1915. The smallest ukulele we make, the soprano offers a bright, traditional tone and is the same size as the ones first made in Hawaii back in the 1880s. Concert Ukuleles Martin has been building concert-sized ukes of world-renowned quality since 1925. Smaller than the tenor, but larger than the soprano, the concert ukulele is a well-balanced, easy to play uke, perfect for anyone just starting out. Tenor Ukuleles first tenor ukuleles rolled off the production line in 1929 and have been a favorite of countless players since.
