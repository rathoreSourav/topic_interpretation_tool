Gilead Sciences Canada Inc.,https://www.gilead.ca/about/voluntary-disclosure-of-payments," * Gilead in Canada
 * Voluntary Disclosure of Payments


VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF PAYMENTS TO HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS JANUARY-DECEMBER 2020

The Voluntary Disclosure of Payments was developed by Innovative Medicines Canada. As a partner in Canada’s healthcare system, Gilead Sciences Canada, Inc. (Gilead Canada) regularly collaborates with healthcare professionals (HCPs) and healthcare organizations (HCOs) to foster scientific exchange, for the ultimate benefit of patients. These collaborations are bound by local and international laws and regulated by Innovative Medicine Canada’s Code of Ethical Practices. Gilead Canada's decision to publish our payments to HCPs and HCOs is voluntary and part of our overall commitment to greater transparency and high ethical standards in our business practices.

It takes more than science to improve people’s health and quality of life. Engaging with healthcare practitioners and healthcare organizations is critical to Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (Gilead's) efforts to advance the treatment of life-threatening diseases in areas of unmet medical need.

Since Gilead’s inception, we have worked together to contribute to our mission of advancing patient care. Fundamental to this mission is Gilead’s commitment and adherence to the highest standards of transparency and business conduct while striving to transform and simplify care for people with life-threatening illnesses around the world.

All payment information has been captured in aggregate form (one sum total) and presented below in three categories:

1. Fee for HCP Services
$1,598,617*

2. Funding to HCOs
$1,712,484*

3. Sponsorship of HCP Travel
$42,659.98*

*For clarity purposes only, please note the following:

 * Applicable taxes may be included or excluded.
 * The values provided may include certain related incidental expenses (such as, but not limited to, mileage reimbursement for travel).
 * Transfer of Value (ToV) is captured according to the payment date and not necessarily the date on which the activity occurred. Therefore, some activities in 2019 are reported as ToVs in 2020, and some activities that occurred in 2019 will be reported in the 2021 report.
 * Payments made to HCOs may include payments that were passed through to HCPs as fee for service and, if so, will be captured in either category 1 or category 2, but the same payment will not be captured in both categories.
 * Total funding to HCOs may also include payments to Patient Associations, as the reporting system does not have the functionality to separate out such payments.
 * Gilead has used its reasonable best efforts to capture the most comprehensive data possible according to its knowledge and interpretation of the Voluntary Framework of Payments to Healthcare Professionals and Healthcare Organizations.

Note: While Gilead makes every effort to present accurate and reliable information, Gilead makes no warranty and assumes no legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the information contained herein. Gilead shall not be liable for damages resulting from the use or misuse of the information contained on this website.

WELCOME!

Partnering is a core feature of how Roche delivers impact to the patient communities we serve. We recognize that innovation is taking place all around us but that there are many barriers to optimal patient care, and we welcome opportunities to work together toward the same goal - better outcomes for more patients faster.

As a healthcare company Roche recognizes the important role we play in helping to shape and improve the Canadian healthcare system and in finding solutions that support the full patient journey. With this commitment, Roche wants to partner with patients and caregivers to include your voice in the work that we do.


DIVERSITY & INCLUSION

Together we embrace the unique power of each person to transform the lives of patients & society.

At Roche, we aim to create an environment where everyone feels a sense of belonging and where we can thrive equally; no matter what it is that makes us unique — age, beliefs, disability, how we identify,  where we are from, or the language we speak. Diversity & Inclusion starts with celebrating our differences and uniting in our commonalities.

We believe that people from different backgrounds will generate ideas that better serve the diverse patient population in Canada and we want our council to reflect that diversity of thought.  As a result, we encourage applications from BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People Of Color), different ethnicities, persons with disabilities, 2SLGBTQIA+, visible and invisible minorities. If you require accommodation during this process, please contact us at mississauga.patientengagement@roche.com.

 


WAYS TO GET INVOLVED

Here are two ways you can get involved:

GRANTS AND DONATIONS

Novartis Canada is deeply committed to providing support to organizations that deliver real benefits to our communities and beyond. To this end, we are implementing new guiding principles to determine which organizations are eligible to receive funding, an using updated submission windows to support this transition.

We have evolved our guiding principles to ensure our support drives impact for patients and the healthcare system.  Starting in January 2022, all grant and donation applicants will need to meet at least one of the new three guiding principles:

 1. Innovative digital and data initiatives that strengthen sustainable health systems leading to timely and high-quality delivery of care for patients.
 2. Health equity initiatives that promote equitable access, experience, and outcomes for underserved populations by addressing their specified needs
 3. Community or system-level improvement initiatives that promote a seamless care experience for patients and their families by simplifying care paths and/or system navigation.

To support this transition, there will be three submission windows in 2023:

 * Submission window 1: January 1 - February 15
 * Submission window 2: June 1 – June 30
 * Submission window 3: September 1 – September 30

A Requestor meeting the above criteria does not guarantee an approval for the grant or donation submission (see submission process section). You can find more information on the updated guiding principles, timelines and requirements here. 

If you have any questions, please contact contributions.canada@novartis.com

   Roche Canada conducted an internal review of all our policies to ensure that they were inclusive of people with disabilities, and has ensured that all Roche Canada employees received training on our policies, practices and procedures that affect the way goods and services are provided to persons with disabilities. This training continues to be provided to new employees as part of their onboarding. Roche will confirm that any staff of third parties acting on our behalf have received training on serving our customers with disabilities. Staff will also be trained on an ongoing basis when changes are made to these policies, practices and procedures.
   
   In 2015, Roche successfully passed a document review/audit conducted by the Ministry responsible for the AODA.
   
   Accessibility has been integrated into Roche Canada’s Diversity & Inclusion plan.  Ongoing employee education and awareness campaigns have enhanced accessibility messages, and helped relate the needs of our patients with needs of people with disabilities, including our own employees.
   
   We have invited external speakers to Roche Canada to educate our employees on how to interact with people with disabilities (2017), conducted an Accessibility Survey in 2016 to assess awareness, consulted to other Roche affiliates to share best practices, and created intranet pages dedicated to Accessibility Awareness.
    
   
   Measures planned beyond 2018:
   
   Roche will consolidate the required AODA-related training into one offering, conduct compliance audits to ensure completion of training, and continue to host various employee education and awareness events.
   
   Roche will continue to consult our employees with disabilities for insights on how to make more inclusive work experiences, and assign relevant mandatory training to respective employees.

Our Human Resources team and benefits suppliers work with each employee and their manager to ensure the employee’s specific needs are taken into account as a customized return-to-work plan is created.
    * Continue to review existing relevant policies to ensure they conform to Ontario’s Accessibility Laws
    * Inform managers and employees of our accessibility policies and provide accessible formats or processes as requested.
    * All mandatory Training programs will be made accessible as required
    * If an employee requires accommodation or accessible formats, Roche will consult with the employee to provide a format that suits their needs.
    * Invite employees with disabilities to identify existing accessibility barriers and provide feedback and input on preventing or eliminating the barriers

NOVARTIS IN CANADA RESPONDS TO COVID-19 WITH COMMITMENTS IN KEY AREAS


RELATED LINKS

 * Grants and Donations
 * Transparency: Voluntary Disclosure of Payments to Healthcare Professionals and Healthcare Organizations
 * Canadian presence
 * Supporting our Community

As the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be felt across the country, Novartis in Canada which includes the Innovative Medicines Division (Oncology and Pharma business units) and Sandoz Canada, is focused on helping Canadians with what they need now and into the future as we adapt to life with COVID-19.
 
Along with ensuring all of our associates in Canada remain safe and healthy so they can continue to serve patients, whether they are working remotely from home or in our essential facilities, Novartis in Canada is mobilizing to meet the COVID-19 challenge in four key areas:

 * Ensuring a continuous supply of medicines
 * Facilitating ongoing and new research
 * Supporting our communities and patient groups
 * Standing by healthcare professionals
    


ENSURING A CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF MEDICINES

----------------------------------------


 



As a healthcare company with a strong presence and long-established roots in Canada, Novartis understands that the Canadian patients we serve – including our own friends and families – are counting on us to continue to provide the medicines they need to stay as healthy as possible and to treat serious conditions.
 
We also need to meet the increasing demand for our products used in hospitals and are committed to meeting these crucial objectives.
 
All Novartis manufacturing sites – including the Sandoz Canada sterile injectable manufacturing plant in Boucherville, Quebec, which makes crucial hospital products – as well as our major suppliers continue to be operational to help us deliver on our promise. We are confident in our supply chain and will continuously assess this evolving situation and adapt accordingly to continue to meet the needs of Canadians. 
 
Novartis is also working continuously with federal and provincial governments and healthcare system partners to find solutions for patients experiencing challenges accessing treatments.
 
One of our actions to ensure continuity of treatment is making vital cancer therapies available for patients to receive at home instead of having to go to the hospital. Part of this effort includes ensuring the nurses we work with who provide home-based care have the necessary personal protective equipment available to safely provide much needed treatments to patients in their homes.
 
We are also ensuring that our patient support programs for those on Novartis medicines for a variety of conditions continue to be available to provide telephone and online services so patient treatment and support needs are not interrupted. 





 
FACILITATING ONGOING AND NEW RESEARCH

----------------------------------------

 
Finding solutions for difficult health challenges is a top priority. Novartis has already launched several important initiatives to contribute to the global pharmaceutical industry and government effort to find treatments and vaccines to fight COVID-19.
 
At the same time, we are working to ensure the many important research programs we have in other disease areas are not interrupted by the pandemic. To support clinical trial continuity in Canada, where possible we are shipping study medications to patients directly to their homes to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on clinical development.
 
In the fight against COVID-19, we have mobilized our global R&D capabilities and have initiated major new clinical trials of promising existing medications to evaluate their potential in treating COVID-19.
 
Thanks to the great collaboration of healthcare institutions, clinicians, regulators, our manufacturing chain and our associates, initiation of these studies has been achieved with record speed with the goal of finding solutions as soon as possible to manage COVID-19.



 
SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES AND PATIENT GROUPS

----------------------------------------




Novartis is also committed to helping as many Canadians as possible during these very challenging times.
 
In April 2020, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. and Sandoz Canada Inc. announced the creation of the Community Strong COVID-19 response program COVID-19 response program, earmarking $500,000 to be given to community and patient groups in Canada to address the needs of Canadian patients during the pandemic.
 
United Way Centraide Canada and Food Banks Canada have been identified as the first community organizations to receive donations through the Community Strong program. Donations will also be made to support Canadian patient organizations with COVID-19-related objectives.
 
In addition, and to respond to the generosity of our associates to contribute to Community Strong, we have established an employee donation program with a commitment by the company to match up to $50,000 in employee donations.





 
STANDING BY HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS

----------------------------------------


 


Novartis associates in Canada are privileged to work with the healthcare professionals who are at the front lines not just of the COVID-19 pandemic but in helping all Canadians who require care and treatment in these very challenging times.
 
Because we see it every day, we know first-hand about the dedication and commitment of our doctors, pharmacists, nurses, technicians, and every other healthcare worker who are doing everything to help their patients stay well and get well. In recent weeks, their efforts have been more than remarkable, they have been heroic. 
 
Every Novartis associate is committed to providing healthcare professionals we work with some of the tools and support they need to help Canadian patients. It is our way of doing what we can to help ensure that we will all get through this, together.

,https://www.rochecanada.com/en/social-media-policy.html,"SOCIAL MEDIA POLICY


Roche Canada’s social media pages are a great way to foster engagement between Roche Canada and our community: patients, patient groups, employees, healthcare providers, scientists, and anyone else looking to join the conversation.  With that in mind, there are some guidelines we need to follow, and ask that you do too when interacting with our social media pages.


THIS ISN’T THE BEST PLACE TO TALK ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS, OR THOSE OF OTHERS

Roche Canada must follow strict regulations that govern our industry and the way we talk about our products. What this means is that our social media channels are not the appropriate place to report side effects, to make complaints or suggestions, or to share experiences about the use of our products or patient assistance programs. This does not mean we do not want to hear about these issues, but these types of concerns are best handled by trained representatives:

Diagnostics:

 * Visit the Diagnostics area of our Products section. If you would like basic information about our diagnostic products. For technical inquiries or information about our molecular diagnostics and life sciences products contact: biochem.ca@roche.com. For our Centralized/Decentralized Solutions and Tissue Diagnostic instruments or reagents contact: Laval.Techinfo@roche.com.

Pharmaceutical:

 * Visit the Pharmaceuticals area of our Products section you would like to see basic information. If you have a medical inquiry please contact mississauga.canada_medinfo@roche.com.

Patient Programs:

 * If you have a question about our patient assistance programs, please our Patient Programs page.

Please note that on Roche Canada-controlled social media pages, we will remove product-related posts where possible, including posts about others’ products.


WE WANT YOU TO REPORT ADVERSE EVENTS, BUT SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOT THE BEST PLACE TO DO SO

If you have a suspected side effect or problem to report regarding one of our pharmaceutical products, please contact mississauga.canada_medinfo@roche.com.  To report a health-related incident with a medical device or diagnostic product, please contact laval.techinfo@roche.com.

You can also report side effects or problems with pharmaceutical or medical devices directly to Health Canada by going at www.healthcanada.gc.ca/medeffect.

If you do post an adverse event via a Roche Canada social media channel, will report the event and may follow up with you directly.


KEEP IT ON THE UP AND UP

This community is meant to provide a platform to engage the community in a thoughtful and respectful manner. To keep it going, we ask that you refrain from any use of profanity as well as offensive or discriminatory language. We understand passion - express yourself by all means, but do so with respect for everyone involved in the conversation. Otherwise we’re going to remove the post and/or block the poster.


KEEP IT ON TOPIC

We're not looking to censor you, but please note that postings that are clearly off-topic, contain unsupported accusations, or discuss competitors, financial matters, ongoing legal matters, regulatory issues, or other elements of our business are not appropriate and will be removed where possible.  Also, ‘spammers’ who attempt to target our followers to offer goods or services will find their posts removed and/or their accounts blocked or reported.


SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOT A FORUM FOR GIVING MEDICAL ADVICE

Though many who follow and interact on our social media channels are involved in the larger healthcare community (doctors, patients, scientists, etc.) this is not a forum for giving or receiving medical advice. Even though the intent is good, unsolicited, unverified medical advice can be dangerous.


FOR CANADIANS ONLY

Our social media postings are developed to comply with Canadian law and are targeted to Canadians only. Those accessing these postings from outside of Canada do so at their own risk.


YOUR VIEWS ARE YOUR OWN

Roche Canada’s social media channels are open to commentary by members of the public.  These public comments are not made by Roche Canada and do not necessarily reflect our views.  We do not endorse or approve of any of these public comments, and are not responsible for the information, references and opinions they contain.


PRIVACY

We do not aim to store or use your social media username or other personal details, unless a side effect or product issue has been reported by you, in which case we would need to reach out to you for more information, and would store and use identifying information such as your name, location, and health related information in order to comply with our obligations to Health Canada. Kindly note that we are using third party service providers to help us manage your comments and messages, which means that they too would have access to any personal information you share with us. Such third party service providers are contractually bound to ensure adequate protection and security of your personal information.

Visit our Privacy Policy for more information on Roche Canada’s commitment to privacy.


FINE PRINT

Lastly, from our Legal Department, please be aware that Roche reserves the right to delete any posting or block a poster at its sole discretion.  Also, by posting content on a Roche Canada social media channel, you agree that we may copy, modify, edit, crop, highlight, and/or republish your content for any purpose.  


CONTACT US

If you’re interested in sharing comments or feedback outside the scope of these channels, or the drug information resources outlined above, you can send a message through the form available in the “Contact” tab on RocheCanada.com.

,https://www.rochecanada.com/en/about-roche/our-priorities.html,"OUR PRIORITIES

We believe in the importance of having a clear set of priorities to guide us through an ever-changing environment. Our aim is to achieve long-term sustainable growth and deliver value to all our stakeholders.


FOCUS ON PATIENTS

We focus on developing innovative medicines and diagnostic tests that help patients live longer, better lives. Two-thirds of all diseases are either still not treated adequately or not treated at all. This medical need is enormous and better diagnostics and medicines can make a huge difference to the lives of millions of patients and their families.



EXCELLENCE IN SCIENCE

We strive to address unmet medical needs through excellence in science. Breakthroughs in science and technology increasingly allow us to find out precisely what is malfunctioning in the body and develop medicines to counter the problem. We focus on oncology, immunology, ophthalmology, infectious diseases and neuroscience, however we remain flexible and follow the science as new insights become available.



PERSONALISED HEALTHCARE

We combine our strengths in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics to better fit treatments to patients. By understanding genetic differences between individuals and tailoring treatments, the efficacy and safety of medicines can be improved enormously. To this end we have a companion diagnostic strategy for molecules we develop.



ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE

We aim to bring our medicines and diagnostic tests to as many people in need as possible. Every healthcare system comes with different challenges and we work with many different local partners to reduce barriers to accessing healthcare and establish innovative, sustainable ways to bring effective and affordable healthcare to patients.



GREAT WORKPLACE

We are committed to constantly strengthening and maintaining an excellent workplace where every person feels valued and respected, and can grow to his or her full potential. Our people make our business. They discover, develop and manufacture our products, ensuring they reach the patients who need them. We believe the key to our success lies in our ability to attract, retain and motivate a highly skilled and diverse workforce.



SUSTAINABLE VALUE

We run our business in a way that is ethical and aims to create long-term value for all stakeholders. We want to create value through developing medical solutions and we aim for as many people to benefit from them as possible. We believe that our success lies in our ability to develop strategies where both industry and society benefit in a sustainable way.

LEARN ABOUT JOHNSON & JOHNSON


ABOUT JOHNSON & JOHNSON

As part of the world’s largest and most broadly-based healthcare company (comprised of Consumer Health, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices), we are committed to using our reach and size for good every day.


OUR CREDO

The values that guide our decision-making are spelled out in Our Credo. Put simply, Our Credo challenges us to put the needs and well-being of the people we serve first.

""We believe our first responsibility is to the patients, doctors and nurses, to mothers and fathers and all others who use our products and services. In meeting their needs everything we do must be of high quality. We must constantly strive to provide value, reduce our costs and maintain reasonable prices. Customers' orders must be serviced promptly and accurately. Our business partners must have an opportunity to make a fair profit.

We are responsible to our employees who work with us throughout the world. We must provide an inclusive work environment where each person must be considered as an individual. We must respect their diversity and dignity and recognize their merit. They must have a sense of security, fulfillment and purpose in their jobs. Compensation must be fair and adequate and working conditions clean, orderly and safe. We must support the health and well-being of our employees and help them fulfill their family and other personal responsibilities. Employees must feel free to make suggestions and complaints. There must be equal opportunity for employment, development and advancement for those qualified. We must provide highly capable leaders and their actions must be just and ethical.

We are responsible to the communities in which we live and work and to the world community as well. We must help people be healthier by supporting better access and care in more places around the world. We must be good citizens — support good works and charities, better health and education, and bear our fair share of taxes. We must maintain in good order the property we are privileged to use, protecting the environment and natural resources.

Our final responsibility is to our stockholders. Business must make a sound profit. We must experiment with new ideas. Research must be carried on, innovative programs developed, investments made for the future and mistakes paid for. New equipment must be purchased, new facilities provided and new products launched. Reserves must be created to provide for adverse times. When we operate according to these principles, the stockholders should realize a fair return.""

– Robert Wood Johnson




A RICH HISTORY

Healthcare has changed for the better over the last 130 years and we're proud to say Johnson & Johnson has contributed to advancements along the way. Since our company's founding, we've pioneered some of history's biggest healthcare breakthroughs. It began with creating the world's first mass-produced sterilized surgical dressings which saved many lives in an era when there was little understanding of bacteria. Being at the forefront of healthcare also means that we have a long history of helping communities.

Learn more about how it all started and the decades of stories that made us who we are today.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES

Every year, millions of people die from infectious diseases.




OUR DECADES OF RESEARCH IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES HAVE LED TO PROFOUND SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES



We’ve been combating global health threats caused by infectious diseases for more than a century. From developing one of the first antibiotics, to pioneering research in HIV, to contributing to the fight against COVID-19, our focus has always been on the prevention and treatment of diseases that threaten people and communities around the world.

The world is counting on us to bring forward new approaches to existing diseases and our work is far from done.




OUR WORK IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES

35

years committed to research to help combat the challenges of the HIV epidemic

1942

the year we began producing penicillin G

40+

investigator-initiated antimicrobial stewardship programs funded across the globe


COVID-19

Dedicated to the fight against COVID-19

We are inspired by a shared vision and mission to save and improve lives and have been committed to developing an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic from the beginning. This includes both our investment in research that could help protect Canadians from this pandemic, as well as supporting the communities in which we work and live in.


HIV

Our legacy in innovative HIV science continues

We remember when HIV was one of society's most daunting challenges, when millions of people lost their lives to the devastating AIDS epidemic. Our scientists embarked on an urgent mission to unravel and understand the virus, which led to groundbreaking research in HIV.

We are still driven to do more. We are pushing the boundaries of HIV science because unmet medical need still endures. Eradication of the virus is our ultimate goal.


ANTIBIOTICS

Continuing research and striving for improvements in the use of antibiotics

We continue our efforts, because we know the world needs it.


EBOLA

Joining a partnership to combat a deadly virus

Since the emergence of the Ebola virus in 1976, periodic outbreaks have been a global health challenge. We are proud to be part of the global public-private partnership that has united government, industry, community groups, scientists, health care workers and ordinary people, to come together to help fight this deadly disease.

MAKING HISTORY IN BLOOD CANCER FOR DECADES

Novartis making history in blood cancer for decades

Jan 24, 2020

By Daniel Hébert, Medical Head, Oncology 

There is no single way to treat cancer which is why our approach to tackling blood cancers is to consistently be at the cutting edge of science and working together as a team, both internally and externally. No exceptions.  

2018 marked a historic moment for patients with certain blood cancers. Words like paradigm-changing and pioneering were used widely to describe the arrival of the first CAR-T therapy in Canada. CAR-T therapy harvests a patient’s own T cells and reprograms them to recognize and attack cancer cells. CAR-T therapy is a great example of how Novartis continually strives to take science further, opening our minds to all scientific possibilities. It also involves many partnerships and collaborations to make these new treatment options a reality, resulting in a meaningful difference for patients in need of an improved quality of life. It takes the involvement of investigators, government, payers, and most importantly, patients involved in research studies. 

Blood cancers are the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in Canada. 21 years ago, Novartis revolutionized blood cancer research when the first trial with a targeted agent transformed patient outcomes for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It changed the lives of many and became the benchmark for how we approach research. The prognosis for the once life-limiting cancer has improved considerably. CML has been transformed into a chronic condition for most and today discontinuing therapy has become a feasible treatment goal for some.
Partnering with leukemia specialists and their extended teams, Novartis was instrumental in supporting the successful implementation of a standardized patient management and monitoring process across the country which now allows patients who achieve a deep and stable response to live without long-term treatment. 

From targeted therapies to precision cell and gene therapy and immunotherapy – we are pioneers, blazing a trail for others to follow. We are leading the way through collaborations and investments that drive research and development across all cancers while bringing expertise, scale and commitment to test new therapies for a variety of conditions.

We want to be known as the company who transforms what it means to live with blood cancer or a serious blood disorder, constantly reaching for new and different endpoints. This is our desired legacy. Canadians believe in us and we believe in the promise of our innovative research and strong partnerships.

THE NOVARTIS COMMITMENT TO PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS

Novartis works with the patient community around the world to discover new ways to improve and extend people’s lives. Our significant investment in research and development underpins our commitment to using science-based innovation to address some of society's most challenging healthcare issues. Only by working together can we improve outcomes for patients and change the practice of medicine.

We recognize the importance of patients and caregivers understanding what they can expect from Novartis.



Respecting and understanding the patient community perspective

We commit to actively seeking out and listening to insights from the patient community to inform decision-making throughout the development and commercialization process for our medicines, for the mutual benefit of patients, healthcare systems and Novartis.

We commit to providing educational opportunities that are informed by the patient communities’ insights, empower patients to seek the right care, and help healthcare professionals best treat their patients.

We commit to working to make our products easier to use, especially for patients living with physical limitations, and we will seek advice from the patient community about how to improve the usability of our products.

We commit to providing easy-to-understand information about our products, including providing timely and accurate medical information to healthcare professionals so they can best support the appropriate use of our products with their patients.

We commit to fully respecting the patient community’s independence and integrity, and to working in a simple, transparent way.



Expanding access to our medicines

We commit to working with the patient community and other stakeholders, such as governments, payers, healthcare professionals and other pharmaceutical companies, to help get patients the medicine they need.

We commit to implementing access strategies for all our new medicines based on three principles: addressing the needs of underserved populations through research and development; further improving affordability of our medicines; and strengthening healthcare systems.

We commit to continuing to provide tailored and scalable access solutions(link is external), including patient assistance programs, equitable commercial models, social business models, zero-profit models and drug donations, as well as to support access by bringing generics and biosimilars to market through our Sandoz Division.

We commit to exploring options to provide patients with access to our investigational medicines(link is external), if requested, prior to regulatory approval.
 

Conducting responsible clinical trials

We commit to seeking patient community input and preferences early in the drug development process, as well as continuously improving how we share easy-to-understand information with patients before, during and after a clinical trial.

We commit to improving access to and participation in clinical trials by using insights from the patient community in trial designs, exploring novel technology-enabled solutions, and implementing strategies to ensure that our trials reflect the diversity of patients.

We recognize that the results of clinical trials(link is external) should be used to advance public health and we commit to giving the patient community and others access to trial information, including outcomes, whether positive or negative.

After the completion of a Novartis clinical trial, we commit to providing the results on clinicaltrials.gov(link is external) and EudraCT(link is external). We also ask that the independent sponsors of all Investigator Initiated Trials(link is external) (IITs) supported by Novartis make all results public.

After successful completion of clinical programs, we commit to registering our new medicines in every country where patients have participated in trials. Where a medicine is registered and not commercially available, we commit to providing it, as permitted by local legislation, to patients who participated in trials to ensure their treatment is not interrupted.
 

Recognizing the importance of transparency and reporting

We commit to transparently sharing information on our interactions with healthcare professionals(link is external) and the patient community(link is external), and to disclosing all financial and relevant non-financial support.

We commit to regularly reporting progress on these commitments.
 

(Signed by the Executive Committee of Novartis on behalf of all Novartis associates)

OUR THERAPEUTIC AREAS



Gilead is committed to advancing care for people around the world, by bringing forward medicines in areas of unmet medical need. We do this through internal research and development, as well as through collaborations with academic and industry partners.

Since 1987, Gilead has commercialized more than 25 innovative medicines, helping to transform treatment for people living with diseases such as HIV, viral hepatitis, cancer and other conditions.


TRANSFORMING HIV

Gilead has helped transform care for people living with and at risk for HIV, pioneering inventions that were once thought impossible – the first single tablet regimen to treat HIV and the first antiretroviral for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medicine to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV infection.

Our work in HIV continues to span the full continuum of HIV care – from prevention to treatment to working toward the goal of a cure. We are committed to a goal of offering long-acting options that can help address the differentiated needs and preferences of the diverse range of people living with and at risk for HIV.

Beyond the science, we collaborate with partners to help address the root causes driving the HIV epidemic. We believe that anyone living with HIV, and those at risk of infection, should benefit from the latest scientific innovations and have access to medicines.


HEPATITIS C, B, AND D VIRUSES

With the same tenacity, innovation and focus that drove our work in HIV, we delivered four curative treatments for chronic hepatitis C virus in less than four years. Today, more than 4 million people have been prescribed our HCV medicines and we continue to reach more people around the world. We have also been on the front lines of transforming care for people with chronic hepatitis B virus for 20 years, and are actively pursuing multiple pathways toward a possible cure. In 2021, through the acquisition of MYR GmbH, we built on our strength in this area by adding a first-in-class treatment in the European Union* for chronic hepatitis delta virus.




INNOVATING TO TREAT COVID-19

When the COVID-19 outbreak began to emerge, we responded quickly to advance our then-investigational antiviral which had shown potential against other coronaviruses in laboratory and preclinical experiments, deploying decades of antiviral expertise and significant internal resources to help patients and communities working to ease the burden of the pandemic. Today, more than 10 million people globally have received our COVID-19 treatment. Gilead also signed non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements with generic manufacturers to further expand supply of the product for distribution in 125+ countries, nearly all of which are resource limited.


IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH CANCER

Significant investments have been made by Gilead to add to our oncology portfolio. Our approach covers a broad range of tumor types, including hematological malignancies and solid tumors. We are working to deliver these medicines to patients in need as quickly as possible.

We are building a diverse pipeline with our first-in-class, ADC molecule in breast cancer. Research is ongoing in multiple other solid tumors.

Our colleagues at Kite are responsible for the research, development and commercialization of our cell therapies.


DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE THERAPIES FOR INFLAMMATION

Gilead is researching new treatments and advancing care to help people living with a range of inflammatory diseases live healthier lives, including diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and lupus.

We are also putting our expertise to work to advance scientific understanding and investigational medicines for complex and difficult to treat fibrotic diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis.

*Conditionally approved in Europe


A HISTORICAL COMMITMENT AGAINST INVASIVE FUNGAL INFECTIONS

For 30 years, Gilead has been invested in the treatment of invasive fungal infections, in particular aspergillosis, candidiasis, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and cryptococcal meningitis. Gilead continues to work to improve access to antifungal treatments for all people in need.

OUR PROCESS


FOCUS ON THE PATIENT, FOLLOW THE SCIENCE

Scientific research drives innovation at Novartis. Our researchers work to push the boundaries of science, broaden our understanding of diseases and develop novel products with significant benefits for patients. We are focusing on faulty molecular pathways and therapeutic areas where we see the greatest unmet medical need and believe the scientific tools to address these needs are within reach.

Research and development teams work together to bring new and better medicines to patients in the shortest possible time. This effort involves a discovery phase, during which a potential new medicine is identified. A proof of concept is established through small clinical studies in patients, after which the medicine is studied in larger numbers of patients in a clinical development phase.

By focusing on the patient and following the science, Novartis has discovered innovative treatments for disorders ranging from cancer to degenerative disease. Thanks to this approach, Novartis has one of the strongest and most productive pipelines in the industry. More than 200 research and development projects are underway.

Addressing areas of unmet medical need through innovative Canadian partnerships

At Roche, we believe in fostering an environment where innovation can flourish and where the patient need is at the heart of our business. We are strong believers that collaboration is the key to this commitment.  Through partnerships, we can build a better future together with medicines and diagnostics that make a real difference to patients.

We strive to work with the top scientists in the world, in a broad set of therapeutic areas, with the best tools and technologies, all with a singular goal: to help patients by enhancing our scientific drug discovery and development efforts. Partnered products account for 45% of our research pipeline and 36% of our total pharmaceutical sales.

Roche has long recognized the importance of external innovation by establishing partnering groups within our R&D organizations. While we are one company pursuing a common goal of helping patients through scientific excellence, Roche and Genentech maintain independent R&D organizations served by separate business development groups. Roche Partnering, which was created more than 10 years ago, supports the Pharmaceutical Research & Early Development  (pRED) group, while Genentech Partnering supports the Genentech Research & Early Development (gRED) group.  Additionally, the Diagnostics Collaboration Division expands our innovation network in the area of in vitro diagnostics.  Each R&D centre not only conducts its own development research, but has also entrenched partnering as a cornerstone of their R&D strategy in order to pursue exceptional science and to pioneer medical breakthroughs.  

In addition to bringing new medicines and diagnostic tests to market in Canada, Roche recognizes that we have a role to play in broader health system partnerships.  We believe that collaboration between our organization and other research-driven institutions is critical to advancing science today and well into the future.

The Roche Data Science Coalition

Roche is committed to working with the global community to develop solutions to the challenges of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. We believe that one important way in which the world can win this fight is through the sharing of knowledge and healthcare data to better inform patient care and health system decision making.  To help achieve this, we have assembled a group of like-minded public and private organizations with a common mission and vision to bring actionable COVID-19 intelligence to patients, frontline healthcare providers, institutions, supply chains, and government. We call ourselves the Roche Data Science Coalition, and together we have developed a centralized repository for publicly available data, as well as data gathered from a patient self-assessment tool, to be used to enhance COVID-19 research datasets focused on informing the management of the global pandemic.



CANADIAN PARTNERSHIPS

As a company, we are known for exceptional science and pioneering medical breakthroughs. We bring that same innovative and entrepreneurial spirit to our partnerships. Canada is a world leader in scientific discovery and many innovative partnerships have come from Canadian institutions and companies.

 * BC Cancer
   
   Roche has partnered with BC Cancer for a number of years on cutting-edge research and projects in precision medicine, onco-genomics and cancer immunotherapy. Through this relationship, we’re supporting world-leading researchers and clinicians who are integrating research and clinical expertise to advance new diagnostics and treatments for cancer patients. As the organization providing cancer care to the entire population of British Columbia, BC Cancer is recognized as a pioneer in the area of onco-genomics and is a world leader in lymphoma and leukemia research.
   
   Roche has been a key supporter of the BC Cancer’s Personalized Onco-Genomics (POG) program that is embedding genomic sequencing into diagnostic and treatment planning for patients with incurable cancers. The goal of this program is to use genomic information to direct patients towards targeted therapies whenever possible. This experimental program has served over 1,000 B.C. cancer patients impacted by 50 different types of cancer since 2014.

 * Foundation Medicine
   
   Roche’s strategic collaboration with Foundation Medicine, Inc. (FMI) is bringing molecular information and genomic analysis to Canadian patients. FMI provides comprehensive genomic profiling to understand a patient’s tumour, allowing a more personalized approach to cancer care by aiming to match their unique genomic profile with approved targeted therapies and novel treatments in clinical trials.
   

 * Princess Margaret Cancer Centre
   
   Princess Margaret Cancer Centre is one of 21 institutions partnering with Roche  through our global cancer immunotherapy Centers of Research Excellence (imCORE) Network, representing many of the world’s leading scientific and clinical experts in cancer immunotherapy. The goal of the imCORE Network is to rapidly initiate pre-clinical and clinical research based on the latest scientific discoveries and to aggregate, as well as share data to accelerate the search for cures for people with cancer. Through this investment, the Network focuses on identifying approaches to expand the number of people who benefit from cancer immunotherapy by exploring new ways to activate a person’s immune system to fight cancer.
   

 * University of Ottawa Heart Institute
   
   Our partnership with the University of Ottawa Heart Institute and Genome Canada not only allows Roche to continue building on our understanding of cardiovascular disease, but it also has the potential to offer the medical community access to new bedside tests and novel biomarkers to offer early and accurate diagnosis.
   

 * Vancouver Prostate Centre
   
   Through our licensing and collaboration agreement with the Vancouver Prostate Centre at the University of British Columbia we are working with world leaders in the field to develop small molecules for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. This new technology is currently in pre-clinical development for use in treating prostate cancers that have become resistant to existing therapies.
   

 * Xenon Pharmaceuticals
   
   We are partnering with Xenon Pharmaceuticals to discover and develop non-opioid based compounds, as well as companion diagnostics for the treatment of pain.  Xenon is a clinical genetics-based drug discovery company engaged in the development of small molecule therapies based on the genetic causes of select metabolic, neurological and cardiovascular diseases.
   
   We’re looking for partners! If you have an idea for collaboration or an interesting technology, or if you have an asset in one of our areas of interest, we would like to hear from you.

WELCOME!

Partnering is a core feature of how Roche delivers impact to the patient communities we serve. We recognize that innovation is taking place all around us but that there are many barriers to optimal patient care, and we welcome opportunities to work together toward the same goal - better outcomes for more patients faster.

As a healthcare company Roche recognizes the important role we play in helping to shape and improve the Canadian healthcare system and in finding solutions that support the full patient journey. With this commitment, Roche wants to partner with patients and caregivers to include your voice in the work that we do.


DIVERSITY & INCLUSION

Together we embrace the unique power of each person to transform the lives of patients & society.

At Roche, we aim to create an environment where everyone feels a sense of belonging and where we can thrive equally; no matter what it is that makes us unique — age, beliefs, disability, how we identify,  where we are from, or the language we speak. Diversity & Inclusion starts with celebrating our differences and uniting in our commonalities.

We believe that people from different backgrounds will generate ideas that better serve the diverse patient population in Canada and we want our council to reflect that diversity of thought.  As a result, we encourage applications from BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People Of Color), different ethnicities, persons with disabilities, 2SLGBTQIA+, visible and invisible minorities. If you require accommodation during this process, please contact us at mississauga.patientengagement@roche.com.

 


WAYS TO GET INVOLVED

Here are two ways you can get involved:

It is always a good time to talk and educate ourselves about human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer.


 

Challenge

Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable cancers today, thanks to vaccination, screening and early treatment. Yet, it remains the third most common cancer among Canadians with a cervix aged 25-34 years old1. Approximately 1450 Canadians are diagnosed with cervical cancer and an estimated 380 of them will die from this disease2.

Unlike the majority of cancers, the main cause of cervical cancer is well known with almost all cases caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is very common3. Over 75% of Canadians will be infected by HPV at least once in their lifetime4. Most HPV infections generally show no signs or symptoms and can go away on their own, so people often don’t know they’ve ever had it5. However in some Canadians, persistent high-risk HPV infection can lead to cervical precancer or cancer, although this generally happens over many years6.

The elimination of cervical cancer will only come from a comprehensive, triple-intervention strategy of vaccination, advanced screening and diagnostics, and the early treatment of precancerous or cancerous lesions.

Unfortunately, the lack of awareness and access to advanced diagnostic solutions is a crippling issue in the fight against cervical cancer. However, a new era of innovative technologies is transforming cervical cancer screening strategies, paving the way for improved diagnostic and early intervention solutions and accelerating the move towards personalized healthcare.

 

Focus

We recognise the importance of advanced screenings and reliable diagnostic tests in cervical cancer prevention, especially knowing the critical role played by HPV – a preventable infection for which a vaccine exists – in the progression of the disease. Our scientists work tirelessly to bring new triage and diagnostic test options to patients across the world.

Our latest developments in the field of biomarker technology helps identify individuals most at risk of developing cervical cancer and single out those who may need access to early intervention and treatment options from those who may not. Relying on risk-based assessments of each individual helps avoid the potential harms of over-or under-treatment.

The elimination of cervical cancer can be achieved through the powerful integration of diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, data and the evolution of personalized healthcare. Having all areas of expertise under one roof, Roche is uniquely positioned to follow this holistic approach to support the WHO goal of putting all countries on the path to cervical cancer elimination by 20307.

At Roche, women's health is a priority, and that starts with cervical cancer.

CORPORATE GIVING

With each new drug discovery, Gilead seeks to improve the care of millions of people living with life-threatening diseases around the world, including regions where access to medicine is limited or does not yet exist.

Gilead recognizes that people and communities often face challenges in accessing the best possible care and we know that passion for scientific discovery alone — and that Gilead alone — cannot solve these challenges. This is why, through our grants programs, Gilead supports patient advocacy organizations, healthcare professionals and nonprofit groups around the world that work tirelessly in local communities to improve people’s lives day after day.

Gilead supports organizations across our therapeutic areas of focus, partnering to advance the goals of our giving mission: to improve healthcare access, eliminate the barriers to healthcare encountered by underserved populations and advance education among healthcare professionals and support the local communities in which we operate.

----------------------------------------


PROVIDING ACCESS

Gilead believes medicines should be accessible to all people who need them, regardless of where they live or what resources they have. Political, social and geographical barriers prevent people around the world from accessing the best possible care, so we work with partners and grantees to help overcome those barriers.

----------------------------------------


REDUCING DISPARITIES

Gilead funds projects that support underserved communities that have systematically experienced disproportionate social or economic obstacles to health.

----------------------------------------


ADVANCING EDUCATION

Gilead recognizes that education is key to effective disease prevention and long-term disease management. Gilead helps community organizations by supporting disease awareness programs for patients and expanding knowledge and skills for healthcare professionals.

----------------------------------------


SUPPORTING LOCAL COMMUNITIES

With more than 15,000 employees working in over 35 countries around the world, Gilead understands how important it is for people of all backgrounds to live in vibrant local communities. Gilead funds initiatives that promote the wellbeing and betterment of the local neighborhoods and cities in which we live and work.

Healthcare professionals visit our gated page

As an integral part of the healthcare ecosystem, we are closely monitoring the global SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. Roche Canada is working proactively with partners across the healthcare industry, including patient organizations, healthcare professionals, hospitals and clinics, governments and regulatory bodies, to keep Canadians as safe as possible. We recognize our vital role in delivering critical products, including diagnostics and medicines, to Canadian patients and customers. 

We are committed to keeping you informed about our products and our approach, offering our support, and demonstrating leadership during this challenging time. We will update this page regularly as new information becomes available. If you have questions or require support please contact us.

If you are a Canadian Healthcare Professional, you may access our dedicated COVID-19 page containing the latest information regarding Roche Canada products and services here.

For SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Tests (for professional usage or self test), learn more here.



DIAGNOSTIC TESTING FOR COVID-19

We are working closely with Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and each provincial public health authority to support their strategy relating to existing COVID-19 testing solutions, including those provided by Roche and according to the needs of the various regions. We are diligently providing our COVID-19 testing solutions to laboratories, public and private, and we are taking the necessary measures to help reduce the impacts of the pandemic.

We have developed a growing number of diagnostic solutions that help screen, diagnose and monitor current and/or past SARS-CoV-2 virus infections in patients. Learn more here.

For SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Tests (for professional usage or self test), learn more here


COVID-19 VACCINES

With the introduction of new COVID-19 vaccines, we understand that patients and healthcare professionals may have questions on how the vaccine may impact people who are treated with Roche products, particularly whether people treated with Roche medicines should/can receive the vaccine, and how they may impact the vaccine’s efficacy.

Patient safety is Roche’s highest priority and we are closely monitoring the evolving COVID-19 situation. We are working closely with the community to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on people who are treated with Roche medicines, and will continue to share new insights as they emerge.

It is important to note that over 180 vaccines are currently being developed for SARS-CoV-2 with accelerated development timelines, and a number of these vaccines use platforms for which there is no prior experience. 

We encourage patients to speak with their healthcare professional about questions related to COVID-19 vaccines and their treatment plan, or for their healthcare professional to contact us directly.



PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

We are working proactively with all of our associated clinics to keep patients as safe as possible when receiving Roche therapy through our programs, and taking active measures to ensure the ongoing administration of our medications to all of our Canadian patients. For more information please see our Patient Assistance Program Health & Safety Update.

Roche understands that many patients and their families have been financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.  If you are a patient who is currently enrolled in a Roche Patient Assistance Program and have lost your job or health insurance coverage due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will continue to work with both public and private payors to find solutions that ensure you have continuity of therapy, and we will close the gap when needed. 


Given the rapidly evolving and escalating health authority guidance and in the interests of the health and safety of their patients and staff, private infusion clinics may make the decision to close.  Should this occur, our vendor network will assess all impacted patients and offer an appropriate alternative setting on a priority basis. If you have questions, please contact the program directly.


DATA SCIENCE COALITION

We believe that an important way in which the world can win this fight is through the sharing of knowledge and healthcare data to better inform patient care and health system decision making. To help achieve this, we have assembled the Data Science Coalition, a group of like-minded public and private organizations with a common mission and vision to bring actionable COVID-19 intelligence to patients, frontline healthcare providers, institutions, supply chains, and government. Together we have developed a centralized repository for publicly available data, as well as data gathered from a patient self-assessment tool, to be used to enhance COVID-19 research datasets focused on informing the management of the global pandemic.


PATIENT COVID-19 SELF-ASSESSMENT

As patient level data is an important part of understanding and responding to COVID-19, the Coalition has made available a patient self-assessment tool that can be used by anyone suspected to have, or has been diagnosed (currently being treated or recovered) with COVID-19. It is available to users via the Health Storylines app, into which patients can report their data.  An anonymized COVID-19 dataset will be prepared and shared with the Roche Data Science Coalition data repository, where it will be made freely available to the research community with the aim of better informing decision making on resource allocation during this pandemic. The app also includes functionality allowing patients to share it with their healthcare professional, providing an overview of their symptoms and health history, which could help healthcare professionas to make more informed and efficient assessments based on the patient’s data.


SUPPLY OF ROCHE MEDICINES

We deploy business continuity plans globally, across our affiliates, international headquarters and manufacturing sites, to help maintain the ongoing availability of our medications to all of our patients during public health emergencies. We have no supply constraints in Canada at this time, and have a plan in place with our logistics and transportation providers to support the uninterrupted delivery of both commercial and clinical products. 


COVID-19 OPEN INNOVATION CHALLENGE

Roche Canada is committed to working in partnership with our Canadian community to develop solutions to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. To move this forward, we have established the Roche Canada COVID-19 Innovation Challenge - a funding program to support our community in bringing forward innovative ideas to address some of the biggest challenges and issues of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Congratulations Canada!  Our Challenge called on all the creative and innovative minds in Canada to bring forward solutions to address the COVID-19 pandemic.  Incredibly, we received over 840 high quality applications demonstrating the amazing skill and talent we have in our country. We are happy to congratulate the winners of the Roche Canada COVID-19 Open Innovation Challenge.1



ESSENTIAL SERVICES IN CANADA

As the products and services provided by Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. in Canada are essential to the Canadian healthcare system, all services will continue to operate as they currently do. For more information about businesses deemed essential services, please visit Public Safety Canada - Guidance on Essential Services and Functions in Canada During the COVID-19 Pandemic.


PARTICIPATION IN CLINICAL RESEARCH FOR COVID-19

Roche is actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio. Canada recently played a role in a Phase III clinical trial studying the safety and efficacy of one of our portfolio medicines in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Similar studies are ongoing globally, where we will continue generating evidence to provide a complete understanding of COVID-19 associated moderate to severe pneumonia. Roche is also collecting and compiling data from other, independently-led clinical trials that are taking place around the world.
