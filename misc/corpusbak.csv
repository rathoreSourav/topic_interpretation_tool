OP0013,"LO (LEARNING ORIENTATION) is another key activity of dynamic capability related to seizing and reconfiguration, two elements that play a role in fostering organizations to become more agile. It involves creating and adopting knowledge to enhance competitive advantage [46]. The elements of LO include shared vision, learning commitment, knowledge sharing, and open mindedness [48]. LO focuses on process mastery, but learning is also assessed in terms of success or outcome [49], [50]. According to Akgun et al. [22], organizational adaptation is seen as the dynamic process of continuous learning, which leads to increasing firm innovativeness by offering new product values to the market."
PP0001,"The introductory and the alignment space are suggested to complement the common exploratory, ideation, and prototyping and testing spaces of Design Thinking to appropriately accommodate the Circular Business Model Innovation context. The framework comprises a Circular Business Model Innovation toolbox (in the form of a system diagram, an idea map, Circular Business Model principles, best practice exemplars and business model elements) that is complemented with innovation techniques of a general character to apply throughout the innovation process."
PP0002,"A value proposition is an explicit promise made by a company to its customers that it will deliver a particular bundle of value creating benefits. While trying to create a new value proposition one should increase the customer benefits or enhance the existing services for better shopping experience. In this case, the long checkout procedure considered as one of the main reasons for cart abandonment, which have greater rate up to 70 percent."
PP0003,"Obtain continuous responses from the staff, incorporating their mind into the new process of change to ensure the internal processes are smoothly running according to the plan. By ensuring that a company strictly follows these recommendations and adopts the recommended value proposition and implementation strategy, they should stimulate a competitive advantage, which not only will help mitigate the competitive threat but shall escalate the brand image as the leader in the sector."
PP0004,"Consumers are looking for economic benefits such as huge price savings; lowering production/marketing cost when consumer uses Mobile Social Networking to make appointments and place orders. Online review allows consumer easily compare products/services, which save costs, leading to perceived purchase reliability, it is the strongest predictor of loyalty behavior. Convenience of search, access, evaluate, transact, possession, purchase and easy accessibility are two critical customer-perceived value for Mobile Social Networking leading to repurchase intension. Consumers preferred to identify people through phone number, easier to be found and easy access compared to user-ID verification and acceptance."
PP0005,"The paradigm shift towards considering the significance of data as a strategic resource as well as an external view with inter-organizational data sharing are phenomena that just begin to gain research attention in the context of data governance. The rise of ecosystems underlines the need to review data governance from an inter-organizational perspective, as novel forms of collaboration between various actors lack concepts in enforcing governance mechanisms for data and challenge established practices. The dynamics within ecosystems are more complicated and diverse because value-creation processes, governance and ownership structures over data become less transparent."
PP0006,"The subject of analysis in the intra-organizational perspective lies on how to set up organizational structures, use governance mechanisms to improve data quality, manage resources across a single organization and define guidelines for the management of data. From an internal perspective of an organization, the execution of decision rights for the management and use of data manifests itself within organizational structures and hierarchies. They ensure that relevant guidelines and principles regarding data assets are in place and monitored"
PP0007,"Users of platforms have limited authority and control mechanisms. Platform users as in case Beta need to consider the implications that arise from the interaction with external platforms e.g. mandatory data standards or authoritative entry barriers (fees for platform participation). Beyond the influential sphere of an organization or platform, little is known about who uses the data for which purpose, and with whom the data is shared subsequently in the process. Thus, the influence of authority for the individual actor within an ecosystem might be limited."
PP0008,"SMEs seeking growth need to consider early and rapid internationalization as many national markets are not only highly competitive, but also too small, mature, and isolated for lucrative growth. Although SMEs can derive scaling benefits from expansion both within their national market and across national boundaries, the latter is likely to provide them with more benefits. By expanding across borders, they can gain access to new markets, achieve economies of scale and scope, engage in beneficial learning opportunities, and utilize low-cost factor inputs, all relevant aspects in business model scaling. "
PP0009,"Customer relationships are crucial for the internationalization of SMEs. Efficient customer relationship management contributes to business growth, and that scaling requires deep engagement and communications with customers. Specifically, scaling companies need to track and align their value propositions to customers and communicate both internally and externally to deliver high value to customers before, during, and after they use products or consume services. Growth firms emphasize personalized contacts with customers and aim at improving customer satisfaction, rather than reducing costs."
PP0010,"Partners provide an SME with knowledge acquisition and learning, as well as important resources. Scalability may require finding new distribution channel partners and outsourcing non-core technology development or service provision to third parties. Digital technologies enable integration and connectivity with third-party services that are provided by global value network partners through application programming interfaces. A SME’s “digital networking capability” becomes of ultimate importance for its growth; in other words, SMEs need to co-create value with various digitally connected partners."
PP0011,"An organization’s success depends on the availability and orchestration of valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable assets, which enable the implementation of value-creating strategies capable to generate rents. Specifically, a company can obtain a sustainable competitive position by acquiring and controlling the resources perceived as strategic and consequently developing firm-specific capabilities that are highly dependent on the types of resources accumulated"
PP0012,"In addition to being used to reengineer business processes, create new products, developing new ways of engaging stakeholders and communities, this knowledge can be effectively deployed for developing new Business Models. In particular, the presence of a trained staff who has the ability to technically handle Business Development and recognize its importance as a valuable source of business information, together with the widespread diffusion of a data-driven corporate culture and knowledge management systems capable of collecting, storing, sharing and utilizing the obtained information, gives firms the opportunity to implement new value creation mechanisms."
KI0001,"The need to rethink the optimal mix of product and service business has been identified, since the digital part of a hybrid solution is always a service. Besides, Business Model patterns which were reserved to digital industries until now, are becoming relevant to traditional good sales industries. Consequently, the Industry 4.0 is pushing companies to a change from product to service mindset. Moreover, many researchers have suggested that manufacturing firms in developed economies should expand their role in the value chain by extending their products with services so they do not have to compete solely on manufacturing cost. The result is the so-called product- service system (PSS) concept, a framework describing the integrated development, realization, and offering of specific product-service bundles as a solution for the customer. As a result, suppliers, customers, and other partners become part of a networked ecosystem around the CPS."
KI0002,"To define the value created and shared in the firm’s innovation ecosystem as a process, we focus not only on the implications of value activities as a strategic resource but we rather adopt a much broader perspective of the value system. The model offers a new way of analyzing three frameworks which stimulate this broader process (value chain, OI and BM), pointing to create an efficient BPM structure across the firm’s innovation ecosystem. Managerial improvements can benefit from this wider perspective by raising quality of open integrated processes, understanding and streamlining distinctive value system operations, implementing measurements and controls by continuous improvement on the use of unique resources (subset of primary and secondary activities) "
KI0003,"Nevertheless, this new industrial paradigm is transforming the current ways of value creation, since it involves changes in the technical and production developments, which in turn has brought extensive organizational consequences and opportunities providing more cooperative environments, improved customer relationships or new product and services offers. Consequently, new and adapted business models are needed."
KI0004,"SBMI faces the challenge of exploring, brokering, and re-aligning organizational boundaries of different stakeholders. However, the processes through which businesses navigate such boundary work for SBMI remains little explored. We address this gap by providing an empirical, detailed description of the boundary work processes for SBMI as a basis for further theoretical and practical work. "
KI0005,"The need to rethink the optimal mix of product and service business has been identified, since the digital part of a hybrid solution is always a service. Besides, Business Model patterns which were reserved to digital industries until now, are becoming relevant to traditional good sales industries. Consequently, the Industry 4.0 is pushing companies to a change from product to service mindset [11, 12]. Moreover, many researchers have suggested that manufacturing firms in developed economies should expand their role in the value chain by extending their products with services so they do not have to compete solely on manufacturing cost. The result is the so-called product- service system (PSS) concept, a framework describing the integrated development, realization, and offering of specific product-service bundles as a solution for the customer. As a result, suppliers, customers, and other partners become part of a networked ecosystem around the CPS."
KI0006,"The horizontal and vertical integration of the value chain and the related interoperability expands firms’ traditional boundaries due to the organization and the stakeholders’ network. New actors arise and the role of existing ones is changing. As a consequence, new ways of creating and offering value through ecosystems that goes beyond individual value chains are raising. Accordingly, traditional manufacturing companies oriented to product sales, feel increasingly compelled to revise their existing Business Models in response to new competitive dynamics and to tap into those Industry 4.0 inspired opportunities"
KI0007,"This context opens up inroads to make manufacturing more responsive to user-driven design and to align it better with customer value creation processes and contexts. From this approach, companies need to develop new capabilities in both, learning more about their customers (using digital capabilities to obtain information about customers, promoting evidence-based decision making, developing integral customer experiences, etc.) and becoming more of an ecosystem beyond individual value chains (become great at building partnerships with new stakeholders). Thus, the Industry 4.0 provides opportunities to create new and more flexible value propositions to respond to customer demands such as the provision of individualized products and even batch-size-line production. Moreover, an enhanced customer orientation is shown by the expansion of innovative service offering."
KI0008,"This transformation represent an incremental innovation that optimizes the actual business without involving big changes. New enabling technologies such as Big Data, Cloud Computing, Collaborative Robots, Additive Manufacturing, Artificial Vision or Augmented Reality are introduced just to optimize the value creation architecture (key resources and activities) due to increasing efficiency and improving performance (reducing costs, time and failures, employee training, etc.). This could be the first step for traditional manufacturing companies to embrace the Industry 4.0 without addressing high risks. "
KI0009,"proposes a completely new Business Model based on new technologies focused on Big Data, Cloud Computing, Intelligent Sensorisation and Embedded Systems, among others, that allow to offer innovative and smart goods and services (e.g. remote installation of maintenance or activation of product upgrades). Thus, a disruptive innovation that provides the change of almost all the elements of the Business Model is needed. This kind of new Business Models might provide the opportunity to firms to diversify or expand their markets. It also could be implemented parallel to the actual Business Model. In this way, the company could experiment with the new Business Model while the old one still provides revenues."
KI0010,"More research is required to understand the process of experimentation with novel and impactful business models. First, what are the boundary conditions under which the experimentation process can produce useful outcomes in terms of high novelty and/or impact for startups or incumbent firms Second, we need to know more about the details of the process itself, such as content, sequencing, types of participants, pace, and rhythm. For instance, how should entrepreneurs or managers decide on which asumptions to test first? "
KI0011,"Sustainable business model innovation is a relatively nascent field of research. This research has reviewed the field and has synergised definitions for the key underlying concepts and identified a research gap in the implementation of the business model innovation process, in the challenges of this process, and in the tools to address these challenges. Based on the research gap we have formulated a research question and broke it down into five sub-questions. These research questions aim to generate descrip- tive knowledge about the process organisations undergo to move into new, sustainable business models, both in the start-up and corporate context. While this comprises the development of an entirely new business model from scratch in the context of start- ups, it describes the transformation from one business model to another, the acquisition and integration of new business models, or the process of business model diversification in a corporate setting"
KI0012,"This model proposes a radical innovation of the actual Business Model which follows the purpose of focusing on the core business (key or distinctive activities of the firm), sharing the uncertainty with other agents or achieving new required skills and resources from associates, due to the introduction of technologies such as Big Data, Cloud Computing, Augmented Reality or Virtual Reality. By this way, the focal firm’s value creation process is linked with the stakeholders’ processes. Moving from value chains to ecosystems and, in consequence, increasing stakeholders’ knowledge, requires a radical change in many of the Business Model elements (key activities, channels and relationships) with both customer and partnerships. As a result, new ways of capturing value should be defined too."
GS0001,"Companies with disruptive value propositions target emerging customer segments rooted in low-end or new markets. Hence, companies continuously innovate their value propositions to move upmarket and attract an increasing share of the mainstream market.. Market disruption occurs when the business model’s value proposition is brought into the mainstream market. Thus, DI is a market-side phenomenon related to how appealing a value proposition is initially to niche customers, and how a company is able to continuously innovate the value proposition to attract larger shares from mainstream customer segments."
GS0002,"It is prudent to focus specifically on value propositions because it has been demonstrated that they have been successfully developed and communicated by less than 10% of companies (Frow & Payne, 2011), indicating the extent of their untapped potential. The development of value propositions is associated with innumerable benefits, especially in a servitization setting that demands new capabilities and management practices. In practice, servitization is fundamentally about changing seller- and product-based value propositions to customer- and service-based proposals."
GS0003,"Building on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the extant literature suggests that value propositions can form a hierarchy with economic value propositions at the most fundamental level, followed by functional, emotional, and, finally, symbolic value propositions. Economic value propositions aim to appeal to consumers through price-based value, which is defined as the lowest price among competitive offerings or the best trade-off between benefits and sacrifices. Functional value propositions appeal to consumers with promises of functional, utilitarian, or physical product performance and benefits that can solve consumers’ problems in efficient, effective, and convenient ways. Emotional value propositions aim to arouse positive feelings and affective states in consumers. And symbolic value propositions promise consumers to deliver positive consumption meanings, whether personal or social. In other words, self-expression, social value, and the meanings behind consumption are major drivers of consumption behavior."
GS0004,"A value proposition reflects the overall objective of a Business Model (BM) and orchestrates other BM components to create, deliver, and capture value. Although value propositions should be used to shape other components of BMs (in a topdown manner), the current literature too often takes the opposite route by suggesting that value propositions are derived from other BM components."
GS0005,"A concept that supports predicting the effect of innovation on business model values. This concept redefines the value proposition logic in business model innovations with five primary variables: business dependence structure, business value dominance, innovation dynamics, innovation domains, and innovation-resources-agility"
GS0006,"Value propositions are vital for facilitating investments and business transactions with external stakeholders , the MaaS strategy and preparedness are utilized to guide dialogue with relevant stakeholders. The goal is to define the role of relevant authorities in enabling the transition. The guided emergence of an ecosystem that can generate competitive MaaS services often depends on some changes to legislation and mutual agreements between partners involved. "
GS0007,"A new company committed to scaling their company value rapidly must develop value propositions for diverse parties. This includes not just identifying value propositions for customers, but also aligning these value propositions with scaling initiatives, and activities that the new company carries out to scale rapidly. This is reported as a major challenge worldwide, which we surmise is one of the main reasons why most new companies do not scale their company value rapidly.  "
GS0008,"Organizations should clearly articulate, and, when needed, change the value proposition – the value created for users by an offering based on technology. A remarkable value proposition focusses on jobs, pains, and gains that matter to customers and achieves those exceedingly well. It is vital to identify how the organization helps customers perform a specific job that alternative offerings do not address. The value proposition dimension contains a portfolio of solutions for customers and how they are offered. The dominant business model is vulnerable to anyone who can use technology to create a better value proposition for multiple stakeholders."
GS0009,"The concept of a “customer value proposition” is indigenous to marketing. The term “value proposition” was originally conceived as a proposition for customers, thus, in our view, it clearly comes from marketing. Since then, as you point out, the concept has been adopted in several other disciplinary areas. The concept has mainly been applied in human resource management through the concept of an “employee value proposition”, and in the field of strategy as a component of the business model."
GS0010,"A business ecosystem is comprised of a set of partners that contribute to the value proposition of the ecosystem’s focal firm. An innovation ecosystem is anchored on the innovation that enables customers to use the end-to-end product, with a functional goal to enable technology development and innovation. It includes three sub-ecosystems: science, technology, and business innovation. Finally, a platform ecosystem is comprised of a platform and the applications that interoperate with it. There are two types of platform ecosystems: 1) innovation platforms and 2) transactional platforms"
GS0011,"The challenge for organizations lies in defining strategies for value generation from the large amount of available data sets. In this article, we discussed how to retrieve value from data and introduced a systematic process that analytics projects follow. First, we described the fundamental building blocks for value creation: business need, data, infrastructure, and analytics."
GS0012,"What creates value for one stakeholder (for example, a customer), who will acquire a customised product and subsequent service to get a job done is unlikely to be aligned with the value of another stakeholder (for example, an investor), who might see a higher short-term return on investment as valuable instead. Thus, working with stakeholders that have seemingly different goals tends to increase a firm’s difficulty to grasp and incorporate disparate stakeholder value interpretations"
MB0001,"Companies whose dominant business model is ecosystem driver — in both B2B and B2C domains, such as energy management, home ownership, and financial services — experienced revenue growth approximately 27 percentage points higher than the average for their industries, and had profit margins 20 percentage points above the average for their industries, according to our research.2 That 2019 global survey of 1,311 executives also found that successful drivers achieve outsized results by attracting the partners needed to provide complementary — and competing — products and services that make their ecosystems seamless “one-stop shopping” destinations for customers."
MB0002,"Four basic elements underlie a structuralist approach to ecosystems. Collectively they characterize the configuration of activities and actors required for a value proposition to materialize. Activities, which specify the discrete actions to be undertaken in order for the value proposition to materialize. Actors, which are the entities that undertake the activities. A single actor may undertake multiple activities; conversely, multiple actors may undertake a single activity. Positions, which specify where in the flow of activities across the system actors are located and characterize who hands off to whom. Links, which specify transfers across actors. The content of these transfers can vary—matériel, information, influence, funds. Critically, these links need not have any direct connection to the focal actor."
MB0003,"The main theoretical premise for ecosystem research is the simultaneous presence of complementarities and interdependencies between actors. Complementarities between actors stem from the fact that the functions performed by their respective offers help to create or enhance the user value proposition. Interdependencies between actors stem from the fact that their offers are connected within a system-level architecture. While complementarities represent an economic relationship between offers in terms of the potential for value creation, interdependencies represent a structural relationship between offers in terms of how they are connected for the value to be created and how a change in one offer may affect the contribution of other offers towards value creation."
MB0004,"A key aspect of research on ecosystems is to identify the bottlenecks in the ecosystem stemming from innovations in technologies and business models and to illustrate how they impact firms (Adner and Kapoor 2016; Kapoor and Furr 2015). It is also important to consider how firms may allocate resources to resolve bottlenecks in their ecosystems through R&D investments, alliances, or even integration into the activities underlying the bottleneck component (Ethiraj 2007 Adner and Kapoor 2016; Hannah 2016; Zobel et al. 2017). Other strategic choices entail choosing markets or technologies where bottlenecks are either relatively easily resolvable or where firms’ control over the bottleneck component may provide it with a source of rents (Baldwin 2018b). Finally, an important implication of the existence of bottlenecks in an ecosystem is that firms would need to develop architectural knowledge not only at the level of the product (Henderson and Clark 1990) but also at the level of the ecosystem. Such knowledge can enable firms to recognize bottlenecks and can provide an important source of competitive advantage as evidence through Edison’s success with electric lighting (Hughes 1993)."
MB0005,"Many ecosystems are organized around a central platform-based architecture that serves as a foundation for firms to offer complementary products or services. There are several important differences between a product-based and a platform-based ecosystem. Platform-based ecosystems are orchestrated by the owner of the platform, who creates the platform architecture and sets the rules for complementors to participate in the ecosystem (e.g., Gawer and Cusumano 2002; McIntyre and Srinivasan 2017; Baldwin, 2018d). Accordingly, the alignment structure between the platform firm and the complementors is determined by the platform owner. In contrast, the alignment structure between the product firm and complementors is typically mutually determined."
MB0006,"The activities, actors, positions, and links are stable; to the extent that there is change, it is at the level of individual actors or dyads (e.g., new products launched through established channels; rivalry among actors in the same positions) rather than affecting the structural alignment of multilateral positions. In such settings, the ecosystem has the taken-for-granted character of routine-as-truce (i.e., Nelson & Winter, 1982). It is when innovation requires a change in the configuration of these elements that the ecosystem becomes apparent and where consideration of ecosystem dynamics becomes critical for crafting and understanding strategy."
MB0007,"As all of this suggests, a strong partnering capability is required to successfully grow digital ecosystems. This capability must be designed to support digital partnering, which is not the same as the traditional handshake and bespoke partnering of the physical world. Traditional partnering often includes exclusive relationships, long-term contracts, and deep integrations, all of which take time to establish and require strategic commitment. Digital partnering creates growth by adding more products and customers via digital connections with other companies that enable fast response to customer needs. It requires the ability to determine and agree with partners about who will create value, how revenue will be apportioned, and what data will be shared; it also requires the capacity to quickly add partners’ products and services via plug-and-play connections that offer immediate order and payment processing, and sometimes delivery as well."
MB0008,"a critical strategic choice for complementors is whether to specialize in one particular platform ecosystem or leverage multiple platforms. Conventional wisdom, and much of the literature on multihoming—that is, the decision of complementors to participate in one or multiple platform ecosystems (e.g., Bresnahan et al., 2015b; Landsman and Stremersch, 2011)—would suggest that complementors should exploit the market opportunities as much as possible; hence, they should expand their market reach across platform ecosystems and product spectrums to benefit from economies of scale. Other scholars have also advanced that complementor firms can obtain benefits from economies of scope by leveraging shared resources to increase the variety of product offerings across different product categories (Yoo et al., 2010; Tiwana, 2015). However, opposing findings highlight the potential trade-offs of product design (co)specialization that complementors face when choosing to develop their products for multiple platform ecosystems (Cennamo et al., 2018). Indeed, these trade-offs raise questions of whether and to what extent complementors should expand the scale and scope of their product offerings within and across platform ecosystems."
MB0009,"Our analysis reveals that complementors face a trade-off regarding their scale- and scope-enhancement strategies: they are better off either specializing in one product category and exploiting potential economies of scale across multiple platform ecosystems or specializing in one platform ecosystem and exploiting potential economies of scope by expanding their product offerings across multiple product categories. In other words, for optimal performance, complementors should increase their investments and efforts within a specific product category and expand its scale across various platform ecosystems—what we call “category specialization”—or they should increase their investments and efforts within a single platform ecosystem while achieving scope benefits across various product categories in that platform ecosystem—what we call “platform ecosystem specialization.”"
MB0010,"Designed ecosystems like Nespresso's are increasingly important, owing to the convergence of three big structural changes in our economy. The first is an unprecedented rollback of regulations protecting firms that once had the exclusive privilege of serving particular customer needs. As those protections fall, organizations in other domains are free to partner to provide more-integrated offerings, as when accountancies team up with law firms. The second change is a blurring of the separation between products and services because of regulatory changes and digitization. The latter has also led to offerings with more-modular structures whose components can be recombined in new ways, which in turn has encouraged the rise of product-service bundles provided by networks of interdependent suppliers. The third change involves technology that is revolutionizing how firms can serve their customers. Our dependence on mobile devices, along with the internet's influence on buying patterns, has dramatically expanded the possibilities for linking previously unrelated goods and services -- reinforcing the effects of the first two changes."
MB00011,"New companies committed to scale need to operate across borders, innovate relentlessly, profitably adopt emerging technologies, and execute capital investment programs that enable them to meet aggressive growth objectives. The successful operations of such companies depend on their constructive engagement with multiple external stakeholder groups. Each stakeholder group has unique needs and objectives. The multiplicity of critically relevant external stakeholders necessitates the formulation of multiple valuable propositions that target very different groups with dissimilar roles, needs, and priorities."
MB00012,"focus shifts into further scaling the revenue model and associated digital services while ensuring it allows sufficient profitability. A first key activity is implementing a modular approach to scaling. A key revenue model challenge for the firms we studied were that most advanced digital services are not easily upscaled, i.e., sold to many different customers, due to the need for high degrees of customization. As a response, firms need to work with core modules that can be adapted to various local contexts. For example, a subscription payment model can have different levels which allows for it to be adapted to varying customer needs. Similarly, at certain global markets, subscription fees may be complemented with add-on expert consulting services to ensure that the digital services are properly implemented and used to realize the intended KPIs for customers"
MK001,"The provider and customer worked jointly to define the value proposition by progressively achieving alignment between identifying value creation opportunities and agreeing on value distribution. A central goal was to identify a corroborated concept (i.e., mutually agreed) for the outcome-based service, which can create significant value and ensure 
that the value thus created can be profitably captured 
by both provider and customer"
MK002,"In terms of innovation, value is created through the processes of inventing, developing, producing, and delivering new market offerings that create turnover. Therefore,  receivers  define  value  based  on  their  perceptions  of  the  potential  usefulness  of  the  exchanged  resource  for  addressing  their  needs.  "
MK003,"Communication of value through carefully crafted value propositions can differentiate a supplier, potentially conveying those attributes that offer a unique customer solution . Supplier and customer work together to share value insights and craft reciprocal value propositions that reflect a value in use perspective. It is suggested that this process is important , as the dialogue required for developing this detailed, twoway understanding forges stronger relationships"
MK004,"Facilitating value creation represents the operations level of 
managing CVPs, in that it connects the company-designed mecha nisms for co-creation of value to where the customers actually live or do business, the contexts in which they assess their options. Firms should possess the fullest possible understanding of how their customers perceive value in their own context, and they should use that insight to develop the best possible tools for customers’ management of value. It is always essential to understand what kind of value is created and for whom, through what kinds of resources and what kinds of mechanisms, from the customer and company angle both."
MK005,"Value capture tasks include  designing the value offering and deciding the profit formula to agree on a mutually beneficial business model. It involves the concrete design of equipment and service activities in terms of scope and allocation, and 
the formulation of delivery-process descriptions and 
expected roles so that the defined outcome-based ser vice was translated into a signed contract. This phase 
placed higher demands on the ability of partners to 
negotiate so that the benefits and the alignment of 
value-creation and value-capture activities could be 
realized"
MK006,"If Internet startup customers in the 1990s gained value from brand reputation and quality assurance, customers in the 2000s gained value from security services and privacy protection provided by each startup. In the 2010s, customers gained trust value from security services and legitimacy. Customers seem to care increasingly about privacy and security, as, the more the world modernizes and technology develops, the more we are threatened by possible information leaks"
MK007,"Changing the value proposition to adopt more sustainability will lead to developing,enabling, and leveraging certain capabilities within the firm that would eventually lead to improving the firm performance. It  will improve the firm’s performance for supply-side reasons by developing sustainability-related capabilities that might help in discovering or creating new markets and sources of competitive advantage. a sustainable value proposition will lead to an improvement in firm performance due to demand-side reasons. According to the demand-side explanation, a sustainable value proposition
increases customer willingness to pay and also differentiates the products and services to attract customers"
MK008,"A key difference between business markets and consumer markets — in consumer markets, explicit quantification of value is typically not necessary. However, in business markets, purchasing managers are frequently required to quantify the value of different offers.“value quantification capabilities substantially and positively influence firm performance”. Thus value proposition quantification in business markets is a key
consideration in effective value communication."
MK009,Identifying competitive CVPs represents the strategic level of their management: it entails matching customer and company perspectives for positioning around creation of customer value for competitive advantage. Identifying competitive CVPs is fruit of stra tegic decisions on what kind of value to create and what kind not to create. It is about segmentation and positioning in light of a logic centered on creating customer value that is intended to last
MK010,"The first and most important task of an entrepreneur starting a business could be to analyze market demand to ensure that the startup will provide the most suitable products or services. After a successful establishment, it is then necessary to remain strong in the competitive market. To ensure customer loyalty, each startup must consider the value it can offer customers in various forms, and how to develop and improve upon this value"
MS0001,"when partners are focused on value‐in‐use as the basis for value capture, trust between partners becomes necessary support for control‐based relationships centered on contracts and other legal agreements. In short, value capture processes involve activities that enable providers and customers to determine how the additional value created should be distributed between provider and customer."
MS0002,The facilitation of cross-border e-business and the integration of operation systems make companies more efficient in export trade activities and also save time and costs for consumers during online shopping activities. The information involved in online promotion can offer further support to consumer decisions by transferring information online.
MS0003,"From the findings of this research, it is suggested that the quality management of packaging in online promotions is important to consumers in cross-border e-business markets. Furthermore, it is suggested that quality management of higher valued products with larger discounts is also important to online consumers in cross-border e-business markets."
MS0004,"Value appropriation capability(VAC)–Technology innovation capabilities(TIC) interaction significantly improves MNC performance, and VAC–Marketing capabilities interaction positively improves MNC performance."
MS0005,"Technology innovation capabilities(TIC) and marketing capabilities(MC) are the central platforms of permanent value transformation from knowledge creation, new products and service processes to cost management and customer delivery; every organisation needs TIC to create value and MC as a vehicle to deliver it to the customers."

MS0007,"In fact, “Attracting resources into a fledgling venture is perhaps the greatest challenge faced by entrepreneurs.” The more resources that a new venture can gain control of, and the quicker it can do so, the better the venture's competitive position and the more valuable the venture can become."
MS0008,"At inception, a startup might be missing resources in three major areas: human capital, social capital, and financial capital. To fill those holes, “core founders” can attract cofounders, hires, and/or investors. Cofounders and hires may bring new skills and industry knowledge, have contacts with customers or potential partners, and also contribute financial capital to help get the startup off the ground. Investors can contribute far more financial capital than the typical cofounder or hire but, as described below, may vary widely in the amount of other value they might add."
MS0009,"Within high-potential startups, the tension between resource attraction and the maintenance of control is real and significant, and that early founding decisions can lead to very different outcomes regarding both value creation and control. These results are robust across two different forms of value creation and across econometric approaches that both (1) use fixed effects to account for unobserved time-invariant company differences and (2) control for individual- and company-level differences."

MP0005,"Big data is used as a basic strategic resource to fully implement actions to promote big data development. A report from the McKinsey Global Institute also points out that effective capture, analysis, visualization, application of big data to insight and achieve business objectives will help enterprises stand out from the fierce competition"
MP0006,"The emergence of big data will definitely subvert the traditional way of data management. It will bring revolutionary changes to data sources, data processing methods and data thinking. Changes in data management methods will inevitably lead to revolutionary changes in the way talents are trained."
MP0007,"Python's programming model is also very compatible with human thinking habits, which helps us to integrate computational thinking into the teaching of Python programming."
MP0008,"‘‘Big Data” is a fundamental element of digitalisation and already a valuable raw material for many industries. In combination with ‘‘Artificial Intelligence”, it is possible to structure, analyse, evaluate and use large amounts of data as a basis for
 software programs that can generate new (or extended) knowledge with the technology of ‘‘Machine Learning”. From this, future forecasts can be derived as well as used in optimization measures. Often ‘‘Deep Learning” is used, which is based on the human brain and uses artificial neural networks to mimic the learning processes of humans. This makes it possible to use data volumes meaningfully across the entire value chain"
MP0009,"Digital technologies are forcing companies to reimagine their customer value propositions. That’s because new social and mobile applications, analytics, the internet of things, artificial intelligence, biometrics, blockchain, cloud and edge computing, and many other advances allow them to deliver value in ways that simply were not possible in the past."
MP0010,"Digital technologies are game-changing — they provide ubiquitous data, unlimited connectivity, and massive processing power. Savvy companies are converting all this capacity into digital offerings: information-enriched solutions wrapped in seamless, personalized customer experiences."
MP0011,"Successful digital offerings are created at the intersection of what technologies can deliver and what customers want and will pay for. That point of intersection, however, has proved to be elusive. To find it, companies must experiment repeatedly, cocreate with customers, and assemble cross-functional develop ment teams — and the insights gleaned along the way must be shared internally."
MP0012,"Digital offerings are well suited to rapid test-and learn iteration because they are software based. Software coders can develop a minimum viable product, release it to customers or a test group, and get immediate feedback. Based on the feedback, a company can quickly enhance or discard the product."
MP0013,"Because of uncertainty around how customers want to be engaged and how they view their needs, the development of digital offerings involves constantly identifying new ideas and testing their viability quickly with customers."
MP0014,"Industries are consequently adjusting to adapt to the continuous usage of data, digital technologies, and digital platforms, eventually re-shaping products, work environments, and the economy. This is also fostered through the entrepreneurship active in Digital Business Models. “The culture and spirit around digital innovation” are seen as fundamental to Digital Entrepreneurship. Thereby, new firms are being set up to bring Business Models relating to Digital Innovation and Digital Transformation to the market and add value. They show a high intensity towards optimization, customer interaction, and utilization of Digital Technologies."
MP0015,The large number of new opportunities driven by digitalization put pressure on SMEs to reconsider their current BMs or critically reflect on their current strategy in order to identify new business opportunities.
MP0016,"extant quantitative studies are mainly related to the strategic and innovation management domain. From the handful of studies focusing on the impact of digitalization on SMEs, Gruber (2018) has recently identified four reasons to explain why digital transformation is taking place slowly in SMEs. First, small companies with their specific foci are less exposed to the need for rapid digitalization. Second, small companies often lack resources and managerial vision to fully understand the impacts of digital transformation. Third, SMEs usually adopt a gradual approach to digitalization compared to larger companies. Finally, digitalization investment within this type of companies heavily relies on firms’ financial performance and it is often the case that they have limited resources to use on this area."
SU0001,Incumbent assets and managerial choices jointly influence performance after new business model addition in ways neither can in isolation. An incumbent firm’s managerial choices for its assets serve dual roles: (1) choice on the timing of new business model addition helps unlock the potential of complementary assets; and (2) choice on the organizational configuration of the new business model helps vaccinate against the detriment of conflicting assets.
SU0002,"To increase the success of the designed BM on the market, the company must analyze various alternatives, have a good understanding of customer requirements, a precise understanding of the value chain so as to deliver what customers need as cost-effectively as possible and on time and should also have a neutral perspective on outsourcing. Hence, the ability to adapt the BM can be seen as a dynamic capability itself."
SU0003,"Predominantly changes in the form of new offers (products, services, or solution packages in the form of cloud computing or predictive maintenance) are driving changes in the BM. As the number of offers, such as services and solution packages, increases, customer relationships are intensified. Relationships morph into long-term collaborations to satisfy customer needs."
SU0004,"It is the learning-driven approach of sensing, seizing and reconfiguring in particular, which provides the business with opportunity to adapt and meet changing requirements in alignment with the business strategy : first, technology and BM sensing implies both the ability to translate technological capabilities to new BM ideas and recognize alternative BMs that are in place among competitors and across industry boundaries. "
SU0005,The potential of digitalization and novel applications as well as an integrated view of the product life cycle are changing the way value is generated and new and innovative BMs are developed.
SU0006,"Companies can be successful over time if they can adapt to their environment. The dynamic capability is a suitable perspective that explains this phenomenon and is even more important in volatile environments. “During recent years, dynamic capability research has developed a framework outlining how firms adapt their physical, human, and organizational resource bases when facing situations of technological or market change”. "
SU0007,"Just as financial institutions try to create portfolios of investments that will hedge one another’s risks, companies can select an assortment of products or markets to reduce the overall riskiness of the business model. "
SU0008,"This has also been confirmed frequently: Big Data (new data sources), automation (changed machine functions), interconnections along the value chain (breakup up of non-transparency) and digital customer interfaces create the foundations for new BMs and potentially restructure the individual sectors."
SU0009,"A key is to secure the alignment between incumbent assets and managerial choices: an incumbent needs to discriminatingly align its assets with the right managerial choices to capitalize on complementary assets and to inoculate conflicting assets, thereby garnering better BMI performance."
SU0010,"An innovative business model can either create a new market or allow a company to create and exploit new opportunities in existing markets.

The role of the environment in understanding social processes has pointed out the necessity of implementing environment–behavior knowledge in architectural practice. The recognition that architecture and urbanism usually do not take into account and consider people’s behavior and individual perception, as well as desires, social norms, dynamics, cultural values, and expectations in their planning perspectives, initiated the methodological framework that enables the implementation of this knowledge in architectural design (Ristić Trajković et al., 2021: 3)."

Products and services deliver fundamental elements of value that address four kinds of needs: functional, emotional, life-changing, and social impact. In general, the more elements provided, the greater customers’ loyalty and the higher the company’s sustained revenue growth (Eric Almquist et al., 2016: 1)."
AF0005,"The immediate concerns of value appropriation, point out that innovation can generate value by asset appreciation (Jacobides, Knudsen, & Augier, 2006: 03). The notions of complementarity and mobility are best treated as independent aspects of co-specialization because they capture distinct economic effects. Complementarity influences the size of the value to be bargained over (some combinations yield higher value, others lower value, depending on their “fit”). In contrast, mobility influences the bargaining power of the asset holders, and thus the division of the value (some assets cannot be replaced other assets can be replaced by numerous equivalents at negligible cost) (Jacobides et al., 2006: 7)."
AF0006,"Innovation also ensures the continuity and sustainability of a company. An innovation could be an implementation of a new product or process (good or service) or its significantly improved version, a new marketing method, or a new organizational method in business practices, workplace organization, or external relations (OCDE, 1997) (Santos et al., 2019: 01).

PZ0003,"Business models capture how firms ‘do business’. Specifically, they explain how businesses create and secure value (Amit and Zott, 2001; Magretta, 2002, p.1). For new technology-based firms (NTBFs) that are new firms in high-tech industries, business model development is crucial for firms’ abilities to create and capture value (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002; Teece, 2010), the commercialisation of their offerings (Dmitriev et al., 2014, p.2.), and, thus, for their performance (Alcalde and Guerrero, 2016; Pucci et al., 2017; Anwar, 2018, p.2.). This model development rarely happens without external assistance, as entrepreneurs (the founders) need to interact with stakeholders to reduce the resource scarcity that is unavoidable in the start-up stages."
PZ0004,"Due to a considerable need in the start-up phase to access resources for the firm to develop as well as no existing organisational rules or
procedurals to follow for making decisions, stakeholder influence may be particularly salient as stakeholders can influence founders’ mental schemas through their
interactions. Thus, stakeholders play a considerable role in how the firm’s initial business model is developed. Accordingly, the roles of stakeholders in business model development are not solely linked to NTBF resource needs, but also provide and influence mental schemas through interactions with the founders.

PZ0005,"Avoid pricing products as “loss leaders,” as it sets expectations and precedents that you can sometimes not change. If you want to introduce a product at a reduced cost, price it as a promotional offer with a limited time frame and/or quantity that is being extended based on a larger, more profitable commitment. Provide after-promotion pricing to avoid misunderstandings.(Harney. 2020. p.3.)"
PZ0006,"the value creation of dispersed innovation is underestimated. While most research explore the impact of dispersed innovation on firm innovativeness by estimating the value stemming mainly from the geographical dispersion of R&D activities, few studies take into account the value resulting from the functional interdependence among R&D and other innovation activities in host locations (Mudambi, Narula, & Santangelo, 2018, p.1.). Given that innovation activities include R&D, engineering, design, and other creative work (OECD, 2018, p.1.), functional interdependence is the interconnectedness of various activities in the same location (Teece, 2014, p.1.). Since functional interdependence can produce complementarity and scope economies for firms to improve performance (Alc´acer & Delgado, 2016,p.1.), we need to consider the value of both geographical dispersion and functional interdependence generated by various innovation activities in host locations."
PZ0007,"The business environment is rapidly changing for NTBFs; hence, the business model must be adapted to changes in the environment to ensure that competitive advantage is sustained (Chesbrough, 2010; Cosenz and Noto, 2018). Moreover, for the new firm to commercialise its technology (product or service), several components need to function together (Dmitriev et al., 2014). For example, founders need to identify customer segments and their needs, determine the benefits of using the firm’s technology, and identify and confirm revenue streams to capture value (Magretta, 2002; Teece, 2010). Several components of a business model have been discussed and elaborated on by extant research. However, the ones most discussed are linked to how firms create, deliver, and capture value (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002; Osterwalder et al., 2005; Teece, 2010). These models include the value proposition, customer segment and relationships, distribution channels, partner networks, key resources and assets, and revenue and cost structures. The value proposition is centred as the ‘heart’ of the business model with customer-related activities and revenues as front-office activities, and resources, partners, and costs as back-office activities.

(2001) showed that the lack of physical experience is a basic reason why consumers hesitate to buy online. Since the use of the purchased product depends on the choice of the right size, fitting is even more important than all other physical properties. “Choosing right size” is cited as one of the biggest barriers against apparel online retailing (Merriam, 2009; Pastore, 2000)."
KP0003,"That the consumer wants to purchase high-quality apparel, which satisfies their fitting preferences, in an easy and cost-effective manner. This is not a
problem when it comes to small brick-and-mortar shops where the consumer can touch the fabric, look at the color, try on the apparel, etc. The challenge arises in online apparel stores, where the consumer is able to evaluate the apparel qualities only virtually. Online apparel stores provide consumers with various benefits, such as saving time and money, 24-hour availability, better service in general, a fast (and easy) process of shopping and a greater choice of products compared with brick-and-mortar shops (Monsuwe, Dellaert, & Ruyter, 2004; Loker, Ashdown, Cowie,& Schoenfelder, 2004; Orzan, Iconaru, Popescu, Orzan, & Macovei, 2013)"
KP0004,"Online consumers are searching and evaluating information regarding the effectiveness of apparel through the virtual product experience (Yu, Lee, & Damhorst, 2012). Therefore, online shops on their websites try to provide the consumer with the most realistic experience, similar to shopping in a brick-and-mortar store. This is achieved through the integration of advanced image interactive technology (Yu et al., 2012), which enables the creation and manipulation of the products or the environment to simulate the actual experience with the product and the environment (Yang & Young, 2009), for example: expansion or zoom, 3D rotation and personal 3D models in a virtual fitting room for trying on apparel. Per authors Loker, Ashdown, and Carnrite (2008); Kim and LaBat (2013); Yang and Young (2009); Boonbrahma, Kaewrata, and Boonbrahma (2015) virtual fitting technology in the online store solves problems such as the fit of ready-to-wear apparel, choosing the appropriate size and style, and overconsumptionof time on the purchase."

KP0007,"Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to focus on the development of a system which will allow an easy online purchase of custom-made apparel of high quality at a lower cost. In order to move in this direction, it is necessary to further develop the technology and integrate it into the system. In addition, a cost efficiency analysis of such a system should be conducted from both the consumers’ and the manufacturers’ perspectives. After the implementation of such a system, the consumers’ satisfaction with custom-made apparel bought online should be investigated based on several factors (e.g. personal characteristics,fashion involvement, body satisfaction, purchase behavior, general attitude towards novelties with an emphasis on new technologies).(ŽURAJ et al. 2017, p.10)."

with this, pointing out that causal inference is typical in the economics literature, but that
machine learning does not address the needs of estimation. Overcoming this limitation is
crucial in the context of real estate, since the interpretation of the obtained function, the
