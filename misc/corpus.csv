G10MS0001,People are not only searching for new solutions to existing problems. They are also searching for new meanings because their life keeps changing and because they are delighted by the discovery of new directions.,"Öberg & Verganti, 2014, p. 77"
MS0002,The outcome of design must be meaningful to others. The product is used to communicate this meaning.,"De Goey et al., 2019, p. 3"
MS0003,"Product meanings could be divided into functional and symbolic product meanings, whereas other researchers distinguish between functional, aesthetic and symbolic design. Although researchers use different categorizations and definitions, there is consensus that the value of products is not only based on pure functionality and utility, but also on intangible values. These intangible values concern for example emotional and socio-cultural needs, symbolism, experiences and psychological satisfaction.","De Goey et al., 2019, p. 3"
MS0004,"In order to differentiate between different types of innovation, Norman and Verganti define an incremental innovation as “improvements within a given frame of solutions” and a radical innovation as “a change of frame.”","Norman & Verganti, 2014, p. 82"
MS0005,"Apart from the identification of the enablers and barriers, the case study (Swedish furniture company) provides insights on how they are connected. Nearly all enablers and barriers are connected to other issues in the product-development process. Some of these links demonstrate the trade-offs FurnitureCO encounters in the product-development process. For example, the color and material matrix enables the company to manage the quality of the furniture in the product-development process, but at the same time it forms a barrier
towards establishing collaborations with the right designers.","De Goey et al., 2019, p. 12"
MS0006,"The identification of enablers and barriers to design driven innovation, and the connections and interactions between them, is of relevance to better understand its influence on the product meaning, as this will affect value creation.","De Goey et al., 2019, p. 15"
MS0007,"limitations in material choice and lack of flexibility at the suppliers influence the overall communication of the new product meaning. Ambiguous product meanings interfere with clearly addressing the tangible and intangible needs of consumers. Therefore, it hinders consumers from interpreting and understanding the added value of the products,
which prevents companies from capturing this added value. This study demonstrates the need to recognize the different enablers and barriers that influence the innovation of product meanings throughout all phases of the product-development process, to strengthen value creation for both consumer and company.","De Goey et al., 2019, p. 15"
MS0008,"Social learning can operate through two distinct (and sometimes opposing) channels: on one hand, it can help consumers sort products according to quality, so to yield them objectively better products; on the other hand, it can match consumers with products they have a strong taste for, so to yield them subjectively better matches.","Bondi, 2019, p.40"
SA0001,"In internet culture, lurkers are a special group of website users who regularly login to online communities but seldom post.four types of lurking reasons are identified: environmental influence, personal preference, individual-group relationship and security consideration.","Sun et al., 2014, p. 111"
SA0002,"The nature of an online community affects the user’s impression of the community and therefore influences the user’s willingness to spend time or to contribute to the community. The five motivational factors related to the nature of the community are group identity, usability, pro-sharing norm, reciprocity and reputation.","Sun et al., 2014, p. 111"
SA0003,"Online communities are a place where people can voluntarily visit and contribute. Recruiting new members is critical to sustaining an online community, and communities must be designed with that goal in mind. While the importance of recruiting new members is often discussed, most studies focused on new members’ socialization and retention stages, in which they are entangled with existing members, rather than their first experience in an online community. Understanding their first experience of the online community is important because their initial decision to revisit to or join in the community highly rests on their initial mental models formed during their first experience.","Kraut & Resnick, 2012; Cho & Wash, 2020, p. 35"
SA0004,"Potential new members leveraged all socio-technical components in the online community and their previous perceptions on the community to build mental models of the online community. Since potential new members are not involved with any members in the community yet, a way of navigating the online community looks similar a way of navigating a general website rather than a typical online community where people interact with each other to achieve mutual or individual goals.","Cho & Wash, 2020, p. 69"
SA0005,Moderators sometimes became moderators because theywere already friends or family with the streamer. Some referred to this as a “token mod” implying that the person did not become a moderator because of merits but because of their personal connections.,"Wohn, 2014, p. 4"
SA0006,"If not appointed because of an existing relationship, moderators earned their status by being a positive influence in the channel and/or a frequent viewer, which brought them to the streamer’s attention and subsequent appointment as a moderator. This appeared to be the most common path to becoming a moderator and considered equivalent to a recognition and promotion of sorts. “You don’t become a moderator without first being a member of the community.","Wohn, 2014, p. 5"
SA0007,"Attracting new members raises the challenges of (i) recruiting new members, (ii) selecting the right members, (iii) retaining newcomers until they have robust ties to the community, (iv) teaching newcomers about expected behavior, and (v) protecting the community from potentially damaging behavior of newcomers","Weiss, 2017, p. 3"
SA0008,"When potential volunteers are recruited through appeals that match their motivations, the appeals are more persuasive and lead to stronger intentions for volunteers.","Kraut et al., 2012, p. 27"
SA0009,"Starting a community requires (i) carving out a new niche, (ii) defending the niche in an ecosystem of competing communities, and (iii) getting to critical mass.","Kraut et al., 2012, p. 231"
AB0001,"While digitalization and internationalization are connected with business model scalability , many SMEs are unable to internationalize digitally because they were not designed to scale that way in the early stages of their existence. This may be partly due to the fact that literature on internationalization capabilities has focused on large multinationals, rather than on SMEs.","Westerlund, 2020, p. 49"
AB0002,"Software systems such as CRM and ERP enable better connectivity with customers and suppliers, and enable tracking and management of both customer relationships and business processes. The ability to integrate those systems reflect a firm’s digitalization excellence, which is a key issue for rapidly internationalizing companies.","Westerlund, 2020, p. 51"
AB0003,"Further, it is suggested that a SME’s “digital networking capability” becomes of ultimate importance for its growth; in other words, SMEs need to co-create value with various digitally connected partners.","Westerlund, 2020, p. 52"
AB0004,"Although the use of digital platforms and third-party services ease international entry barriers by helping SMEs overcome resource constraints, there is also need for elementary internal staff recruitments (Jin & Hurd, 2018). Indeed, Rachinger et al. (2019) found that employee’s  competences are among the most significant future  challenges for SMEs considering digitalized business model innovation.","Westerlund, 2020, p.  53"
AB0005,"This study specifies that internationalization of online SMEs is associated with being able to create new partnerships and foster interorganizational system and service integration, particularly with large international online marketplaces and platforms. Further, the use of critical information systems such as CRM and ERP software for managing customer relationships and business processes in the digital and international environment is essential.","Westerlund, 2020, p. 54"
AB0006,"However, in line with Bailetti and Craigen (2020) who argue that cybersecurity is not only about protection but also about innovation, the present study argues that cybersecurity is both a necessity and an enabler of scaling through digital internationalization.","Westerlund, 2020, p. 54 "
AB0007,"Regarding implications for practice, our results suggest that SMEs seeking growth through digital internationalization need to develop a set of capabilities, specifically in regard to partnering, customer relationship, and business process management, as well as invest in ICT resources and cyber resilience.","Westerlund, 2020, p. 54 "
AB0008,New ventures that can successfully adopt digital technologies and develop the necessary capabilities to use those resources along the value chain are able to generate a variety of benefits to overcome the liabilities of newness and smallness.,"Rosin et al., 2020, p. 3 "
AB0009,"Organizations that can, for example, digitalize information-intensive process- es are able to replace manual steps, which helps streamline actions. Thus, an integrated digitalization enables new ventures to track processes in real time so that workflows become more transparent, which allows for not only faster decision making but also the identification of processes with improvement potential, which might result in cost savings.","Rosin et al., 2020, p. 3 "
AB0010,"One of the benefits of digitalisation is that, It further helps organizations identify risk factors. The continuous access to real-time data provides managers with the opportunity to react before problems occur, resulting in potential cost savings. Thus, we believe that the more parts along the value chain are digitalized, the higher are the resource savings.","Rosin et al., 2020, p. 3"
AB0011,"In addition, with digitalization comes the “ability to turn existing products or services into digital variants, and, thus, offer advantages over tangible products”. This way, new products can be introduced to the market more easily. Furthermore, a high degree of digitalization enables firms to get digital customer feedback through digital platforms. This way, new ventures can integrate customers’ opinions as they develop digital innovations.","Rosin et al., 2020, p. 4 "
AB0012,"Our results further show that a high degree of digitalization results in greater market flexibility, such that new ventures integrating digital technologies are able to react quickly to changing market conditions.","Rosin et al., 2020, p. 9"
MA0001,"Managers pursuing transnational entrepreneurship should seriously consider establishing operations in a second country,which will provide access to people and assets that will increase the new company’s capacity to create and capture value","Bailetti E, 2018,  p. 34"
MA0002,"The role of cross border resouces emerges clearly from this empirical analysis: they can offer competitive advantages since they can ensure access to external resources such as capital, labour and wealthier markets.","Cappellano & Rizzo,b2019, p. 462"
MA0003,"Customer experience is definitely the key to strengthening the cross-border sales. Some of your customers will be promoters, satisfied with your company and happy to put in a good word for you is likely to help you grow your business.","Kulach Karolina, 2021"
