It is also important to consider how firms may allocate resources to resolve bottlenecks in their ecosystems through R&D investments, alliances, or even integration into the activities underlying the bottleneck component (Ethiraj 2007 Adner and Kapoor 2016; Hannah 2016; Zobel et al. 2017). Other strategic choices entail choosing markets or technologies where bottlenecks are either relatively easily resolvable or where firms’ control over the bottleneck component may provide it with a source of rents (Baldwin 2018b). Finally, an important implication of the existence of bottlenecks in an ecosystem is that firms would need to develop architectural knowledge not only at the level of the product (Henderson and Clark 1990) but also at the level of the ecosystem. Such knowledge can enable firms to recognize bottlenecks and can provide an important source of competitive advantage as evidence through Edison’s success with electric lighting (Hughes 1993)."

Such expectations will constrain, to some extent, entrepreneurial creativity and innovation. Of course, those expectations might also educate entrepreneurs by showing them what they are supposed to do, depending on the context. Many of these expectations come from institutions, which are collections of stable rules and roles with a corresponding set of meanings that constrain actions ([20]), leading humans to select activities based on their appropriateness, rather than on more technical but potentially less appropriate criteria ([14])."

Customers can develop customer value by doing it themselves (insourcing), which is popular in B2B markets. While this is incredibly effective, internal turf difficulties, transfer pricing issues, and distributing the surplus generated by value_creation among multiple internal business units may make it inefficient. When a client outsources value_creation operations to independent contractors and suppliers, value in exchange is created. The supplier business benefits from the discipline of competitive pricing in unfettered marketplaces since it drives cost efficiency. Companies that are unable to create value are doomed to fail as a result of constructive destruction. While market efficiency may exist, it may also result in market failures or partial failures in terms of ignoring and serving particular portions of society due to affordability and accessibility concerns."

Moreover, for the new firm to commercialise its technology (product or service), several components need to function together (Dmitriev et al., 2014). For example, founders need to identify customer segments and their needs, determine the benefits of using the firm’s technology, and identify and confirm revenue streams to capture value (Magretta, 2002; Teece, 2010). Several components of a business_model have been discussed and elaborated on by extant research. However, the ones most discussed are linked to how firms create, deliver, and capture value (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002; Osterwalder et al., 2005; Teece, 2010). These models include the value_proposition, customer segment and relationships, distribution channels, partner networks, key resources and assets, and revenue and cost structures. The value_proposition is centred as the ‘heart’ of the business_model with customer-related activities and revenues as front-office activities, and resources, partners, and costs as back-office activities.

The digital transformation that induces a radical change in organizations is expressed by all of the scientific articles, while its concrete definition is not been widely accepted till now. The acceleration in digital technological development, together with the increasing globalization of associated economies, is increasing innovation cycles for products and services.

Both terms refer to the same object, although they mean different things. Digitization is the translation of analog information into digital forms, whereas digitalization is the arrangement of multiple and various social life areas via digital communication technology. Digitalization technologies consist of artificial intelligence (AI), robots, automation, the Internet of Things, big_data, 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, drones, cyber weapons. dDgitalization refers to the use of any digitalization technology on any part of the commercialization activities of companies."

From the handful of studies focusing on the impact of digitalization on SMEs, Gruber (2018) has recently identified four reasons to explain why digital transformation is taking place slowly in SMEs. First, small companies with their specific foci are less exposed to the need for rapid digitalization. Second, small companies often lack resources and managerial vision to fully understand the impacts of digital transformation. Third, SMEs usually adopt a gradual approach to digitalization compared to larger companies. Finally, digitalization investment within this type of companies heavily relies on firms’ financial performance and it is often the case that they have limited resources to use on this area."

From this approach, companies need to develop new capabilities in both, learning more about their customers (using digital capabilities to obtain information about customers, promoting evidence-based decision making, developing integral customer experiences, etc.) and becoming more of an ecosystem beyond individual value chains (become great at building partnerships with new stakeholders). Thus, the Industry 4.0 provides opportunities to create new and more flexible value_propositions to respond to customer_demands such as the provision of individualized products and even batch-size-line production. Moreover, an enhanced customer orientation is shown by the expansion of innovative service offering."

A first key activity is implementing a modular approach to scaling. A key revenue_model challenge for the firms we studied were that most advanced digital services are not easily upscaled, i.e., sold to many different customers, due to the need for high degrees of customization. As a response, firms need to work with core modules that can be adapted to various local contexts. For example, a subscription payment model can have different levels which allows for it to be adapted to varying customer needs. Similarly, at certain global markets, subscription fees may be complemented with add-on expert consulting services to ensure that the digital services are properly implemented and used to realize the intended KPIs for customers"

The model offers a new way of analyzing three frameworks which stimulate this broader process (value chain, OI and BM), pointing to create an efficient BPM structure across the firm’s innovation ecosystem. Managerial improvements can benefit from this wider perspective by raising quality of open integrated processes, understanding and streamlining distinctive value system operations, implementing measurements and controls by continuous_improvement on the use of unique_resources (subset of primary and secondary activities) "

We fill a vacuum in the value_proposition literature in this paper by highlighting qualities that distinguish new company value_propositions from existing resources, as well as factors that make them useful. A value_proposition is defined as something that facilitates and improves commercial transactions between a new business and its external stakeholders. According to the article, two elements distinguish new company value_propositions: (1) business transactions with one or more external stakeholders, and (2) investments to establish and improve a new firm's value_propositions that enable business transactions."

Platform users as in case Beta need to consider the implications that arise from the interaction with external platforms e.g. mandatory data standards or authoritative entry barriers (fees for platform participation). Beyond the influential sphere of an organization or platform, little is known about who uses the data for which purpose, and with whom the data is shared subsequently in the process. Thus, the influence of authority for the individual actor within an ecosystem might be limited."
1.0,0.9727,"ecosystem, company, customer, platform, stakeholder, data, community, crossborder, service, participation","Many ecosystems are organized around a central platform-based architecture that serves as a foundation for firms to offer complementary products or services. There are several important differences between a product-based and a platform-based ecosystem. Platform-based ecosystems are orchestrated by the owner of the platform, who creates the platform architecture and sets the rules for complementors to participate in the ecosystem (e.g., Gawer and Cusumano 2002; McIntyre and Srinivasan 2017; Baldwin, 2018d). Accordingly, the alignment structure between the platform firm and the complementors is determined by the platform owner. In contrast, the alignment structure between the product firm and complementors is typically mutually determined."

with this, pointing out that causal inference is typical in the economics literature, but that
machine_learning does not address the needs of estimation. Overcoming this limitation is
crucial in the context of real estate, since the interpretation of the obtained function, the

This meant taking the initial estimates from the first phase further by clearly defining how and under what conditions each party would profit from the agreement. Specifically, agreements must be formulated on how costs and revenues will flow under defined operating conditions and in various scenarios. In essence, such a mechanism defined the governance structure that will facilitate a smoothly operating outcome-based_service.

This capability must be designed to support digital partnering, which is not the same as the traditional handshake and bespoke partnering of the physical world. Traditional partnering often includes exclusive relationships, long-term contracts, and deep integrations, all of which take time to establish and require strategic commitment. Digital partnering creates growth by adding more products and customers via digital connections with other companies that enable fast response to customer needs. It requires the ability to determine and agree with partners about who will create value, how revenue will be apportioned, and what data will be shared; it also requires the capacity to quickly add partners’ products and services via plug-and-play connections that offer immediate order and payment processing, and sometimes delivery as well."

Because technologies might be viewed as tools or strategies for completing specific tasks, they have no intrinsic worth and must be integrated into social contexts that are frequently dynamic and gender-based. According to Huyer and Sikoska (2003), women must be persuaded that ICTs are beneficial to them. In addition, because today's ICTs aren't gender-neutral, they aren't always acceptable for women's requirements (Huyer & Sikoska, 2003); at least not without proper adaption."

It focuses totally on finding new ways to come up with revenues and define value_propositions for customers, suppliers and partners. Due to the ever-increasing pace of technological developments and access to new technologies, alliances became a critical competitive advantage in many industries. While checking out BMI opportunities, incumbents are increasingly venturing into new business segments. Against the background of an absence of experience and/or resources, firms searched for partners to get access to necessary resources. We call such an alliance a business_model innovation alliance (BMIA)."

Over time, through incremental improvement of technology or process, a disruptive_innovation gradually satisfies the needs of mainstream consumers, so as to attain certain market share from or even replace incumbents in mainstream markets."

Hence, companies continuously innovate their value_propositions to move upmarket and attract an increasing share of the mainstream market.. Market disruption occurs when the business_model’s value_proposition is brought into the mainstream market. Thus, DI is a market-side phenomenon related to how appealing a value_proposition is initially to niche customers, and how a company is able to continuously innovate the value_proposition to attract larger shares from mainstream customer segments."

New companies that wish to scale rapidly require value_proposition development capabilities that go beyond the ones required by companies that have small or moderate growth objectives. Diverse value_propositions, all having a logic to scale early and rapidly since inception, must be developed. Each value_proposition must then be aligned with the value_propositions of all other key stakeholders, as well as with the new company’s pathway to scale."

These innovations are designed for customers for whom the incumbent’s offer provides excess functionality at unaffordable prices. Such disruptions are associated with the strategies of opportunities discovery. Incumbents pay less attention to less-discerning customers and typically offer their products to their most profitable, more discerning customers"

Based on this understanding, digitalization's role in defining an SME's competitive advantages, as well as its interaction with other factors, is vital to their planning and decision-making. In order for SMEs to accelerate their internationalization, it is important to understand the relationships between digitalization, various resources, and the capabilities that give a firm a competitive advantage. The major goal of this research is to look at how digitalization affects SMEs and to construct a model for the factors that influence SMEs' competitiveness in international marketplaces, with a focus on digitalization, resources, and competencies."

A remarkable value_proposition focusses on jobs, pains, and gains that matter to customers and achieves those exceedingly well. It is vital to identify how the organization helps customers perform a specific job that alternative offerings do not address. The value_proposition dimension contains a portfolio of solutions for customers and how they are offered. The dominant business_model is vulnerable to anyone who can use technology to create a better value_proposition for multiple_stakeholders."
