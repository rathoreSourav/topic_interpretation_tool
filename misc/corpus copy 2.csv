MS0003,"Product meanings could be divided into functional and symbolic product meanings, whereas other researchers distinguish between functional, aesthetic and symbolic design. Although researchers use different categorizations and definitions, there is consensus that the value of products is not only based on pure functionality and utility, but also on intangible values. These intangible values concern for example emotional and socio-cultural needs, symbolism, experiences and psychological satisfaction.","De Goey et al., 2019, p. 3"

MS0005,"Apart from the identification of the enablers and barriers, the case study (Swedish furniture company) provides insights on how they are connected. Nearly all enablers and barriers are connected to other issues in the product-development process. Some of these links demonstrate the trade-offs FurnitureCO encounters in the product-development process. For example, the color and material matrix enables the company to manage the quality of the furniture in the product-development process, but at the same time it forms a barrier
towards establishing collaborations with the right designers.","De Goey et al., 2019, p. 12"

MS0007,"limitations in material choice and lack of flexibility at the suppliers influence the overall communication of the new product meaning. Ambiguous product meanings interfere with clearly addressing the tangible and intangible needs of consumers. Therefore, it hinders consumers from interpreting and understanding the added value of the products,
which prevents companies from capturing this added value. This study demonstrates the need to recognize the different enablers and barriers that influence the innovation of product meanings throughout all phases of the product-development process, to strengthen value creation for both consumer and company.","De Goey et al., 2019, p. 15"

SA0003,"Online communities are a place where people can voluntarily visit and contribute. Recruiting new members is critical to sustaining an online community, and communities must be designed with that goal in mind. While the importance of recruiting new members is often discussed, most studies focused on new members’ socialization and retention stages, in which they are entangled with existing members, rather than their first experience in an online community. Understanding their first experience of the online community is important because their initial decision to revisit to or join in the community highly rests on their initial mental models formed during their first experience.","Kraut & Resnick, 2012; Cho & Wash, 2020, p. 35"
SA0004,"Potential new members leveraged all socio-technical components in the online community and their previous perceptions on the community to build mental models of the online community. Since potential new members are not involved with any members in the community yet, a way of navigating the online community looks similar a way of navigating a general website rather than a typical online community where people interact with each other to achieve mutual or individual goals.","Cho & Wash, 2020, p. 69"

AA0001,"It should be noted that the word VALUE has two separate definitions, expressing both the utility of a particular object and the power to purchase other products that the possession of that object confers. The first is referred to as 'value in use,' while the second is referred to as 'value in exchange.' The items that have the most value in use often have little or no value in exchange; on the other hand, the things that have the most worth in exchange often have little or no value in use.","Eggert et al., 2018, pp. 80-90"
AA0002,"Capitalism is based on the generation of value. Customers can develop customer value by doing it themselves (insourcing), which is popular in B2B markets. While this is incredibly effective, internal turf difficulties, transfer pricing issues, and distributing the surplus generated by value creation among multiple internal business units may make it inefficient. When a client outsources value creation operations to independent contractors and suppliers, value in exchange is created. The supplier business benefits from the discipline of competitive pricing in unfettered marketplaces since it drives cost efficiency. Companies that are unable to create value are doomed to fail as a result of constructive destruction. While market efficiency may exist, it may also result in market failures or partial failures in terms of ignoring and serving particular portions of society due to affordability and accessibility concerns.","Sheth, 2020, pp. 312-315"
AA0003,"Organizations feel obligated to tell us ""what"" they do without first explaining ""why."" Understanding the need (the why) before focusing on the outcome is an important part of the design process (the what). If successful, an organization's 'why' can inspire long-term buy-in from employees and customers by resonating on a deeper, emotional level. The 'Golden Circle' concept, developed by Simon Sinek, was used to examine 100 organisations' value propositions across sixteen industries in order to better understand how they are currently conveying their what, how, and why. When compared to the how and what outcomes, only 24% of organisations explicitly stated their ""why."" This article uses an iterative design method to help firms better understand their value, allowing them to establish their ""why"" from the inside out. This article illustrates why analysing an organization's value proposition should be at the centre of strategy decisions and communication.","Straker & Nusem, 2019, pp. 59–76 "

Mobile social networking has evolved into a critical communication tool, a new trend, a necessity, and a way of life. With information transparency, consumer value shifts quickly, and rapid adaption of similar services in the market place makes it critical for suppliers to keep up with these shifts, which have a direct impact on customer happiness and loyalty. The study considers WeChat (1 billion active users) as the company under study and compares it to WhatsApp (1.5 billion active users) as the main competitor in the industry to establish a value proposition in the real world. Customers' perceptions of value for mobile social networking services are identified, followed by a critical review of the existing value proposition of WeChat with Whatsapp to identify gaps, and lastly, a new value proposition for WeChat is proposed.","Wan et al, 2019, pp. 1091-1115"

In response, this article provides a comprehensive review of the fragmented CVP literature, highlighting the lack of a strong theoretical foundation; distinguishes CVPs from related concepts; proposes a conceptual model of the CVP that includes antecedents, consequences, and moderators, as well as several research propositions; illustrates the application of the CVP concept to four different companies; and advances a compelling research agenda.","Payne, Frow & Eggert, 2017, pp. 467–489."

The multiplicity of critically relevant external stakeholders necessitates the formulation of multiple valuable propositions that target very different groups with dissimilar roles, needs, and priorities.","Bailetti, T et al., 2020 p 15"
SR 004,"Managing a “portfolio of diverse value propositions” requires the development of company capabilities that can configure internal and external resources in a way to deliver promises made to the different external stakeholders, as well as achieve the objectives of the company’s master scaling plan. New companies that wish to scale rapidly require value proposition development capabilities that go beyond the ones required by companies that have small or moderate growth objectives. Diverse value propositions, all having a logic to scale early and rapidly since inception, must be developed. Each value proposition must then be aligned with the value propositions of all other key stakeholders, as well as with the new company’s pathway to scale.","Bailetti, T et al., 2020 p 15"
SR 005,"The elemental version of our value proposition perspective applies to multiple stakeholders and incorporates what we call “reciprocal dialogues”. It highlights the need for a new company to develop two types of value propositions (1) value propositions to anchor business transactions (set prices for good and services) or investment (set company valuation), and (2) value propositions to attract external partners to make commitments to create and improve the already existing value propositions that enable business transactions (set terms for information and technology exchanges during product feature co-creation).","Bailetti, T et al., 2020 p 17"

SR015,"One distinguishing feature concerns the rapidness of growth, with the highest pace of growth typically evident in the scaling stage of the organizational life cycle (Coad, 2018). In fact, many scaling firms exhibit hyper growth rates exceeding 40% annually (World Economic Forum, 2016), which is substantially above the 20% rate that normally denotes high growth (OECD, 2007). Another distinct feature of scaling strategies is that, compared to high growth in mature firms, which typically deal with path dependencies and rigidities while attempting to grow (Sirmon et al., 2011), scaling firms need to deal with a sense of turmoil, chaos, and great inefficiencies while growing. This is because the internal organization of scaling firms is neither well developed nor cost-optimized (DeSantola and Gulati, 2017; Sullivan, 2016), and there are limits for an organization to learn from prior experience if resource development is compressed in time (Dierickx and Cool, 1989).",D. Piaskowska et al. 2019 P3
SR016,"Scaling strategies are also distinct because of their focus on capacity boosting to exploit the viable business model at scale (Autio, 2016; Reuber et al., 2021; Sullivan, 2016; Zhao et al., 2020), where substantial economies of scale can be accrued, especially when the firm has a digital business model (Coviello, 2020; Tippmann et al., 2018). Capacity boosting requires an increasing commitment to bundling resources into formalized activities. This contrasts with the resource flexibility required for experimentation during the start-up phase (Clarysse et al., 2011; Sirmon et al., 2011).",D. Piaskowska et al. 2019 P3
SR017,"When entrepreneurs begin the process of organizing their new ventures, they encounter contexts in which other people—vendors, investors, employees, customers, regulators, and so forth—already have their own expectations concerning entrepreneurship and the practices, processes, and products they will be offered ([ 5]). Such expectations will constrain, to some extent, entrepreneurial creativity and innovation. Of course, those expectations might also educate entrepreneurs by showing them what they are supposed to do, depending on the context. Many of these expectations come from institutions, which are collections of stable rules and roles with a corresponding set of meanings that constrain actions ([20]), leading humans to select activities based on their appropriateness, rather than on more technical but potentially less appropriate criteria ([14]).","Aldrich and Ruef, 2018. p12"

It is defined as “a strategic tool facilitating communication of an organization's ability to share resources and offer a superior value package to targeted customers” . Seen through a strategic lens, customer value propositions have a dual role. First, they communicate a superior value creation potential to targeted customers. Second, they summarize the essence of marketing strategy decisions and signal implementation priorities to the actors in the supplier organization.","Eggert, et al., 2018; Payne et al., 2017, p. 472; Eggert et al., 2020, p.242."

"
DU0007,"To be effective, the analysis of customer value has to be fine-grained: A major insight is the need to consider value proposition (what is promised), value targeting (who is the primary recipient) and value delivery (how the promise is fulfilled) separately, which most companies don’t do.","Biloshapka,Osiyevskyy. , 2018, p.46."
DU0008,"A superior value proposition has to be matched with correct value targeting. Who is the primary customer being offered the best-in-class value? A business model is intended to serve all stakeholders of the firm, including end-users, buyers, sales channel partners, key suppliers and obviously investors. Yet, in most cases it is impossible to maximize the value provided to each stakeholder. Therefore, while providing sufficient value to each critical stakeholder to ensure their buy-in, management must choose a key stakeholder and focus all its efforts on optimizing the value provided to this primary customer.","Biloshapka, Osiyevskyy. , 2018, p.46."
DU0009,"Value propositions capture the essence of marketing strategy decisions and signal strategic priorities to the supplier organization and its customers. Against the backdrop of firms' resources and capabilities, value propositions delineate the superior contribution to their goals that targeted customers can expect from engaging with the supplier firm.

DU0011,"A customer value proposition (CVP) is a strategic tool facilitating communication of an organization's ability to share resources and offer a superior value package to targeted customers. In contrast with other definitions and descriptions, this definition (1) highlights CVP's critical role as a communication device, (2) emphasizes the role of resources and resource sharing, and (3) stresses the need for an appropriate ""package"" of value that is differentiated from and superior to competitive offerings.","Rintamaki et al. 2007; Skålén et al. 2015;Payne, A., et al., 2017, p. 472."
DU0012,"There are four CVP perspectives, that indicate if it is effective or not: First, the value package should include both benefits and costs that establish clear differentiation from competitive offerings and are important to targeted customers. Second, a necessary consideration involves how value gets distributed across the customer relationship, before, during, and after the usage experience, including when the greatest value might be created. Third, nature of the resource sharing is pertinent, especially in instances in which deeper reciprocal engagement might result in meaningfully cocreated CVPs. Fourth, firms must determine which CVP design characteristics to emphasize when developing value propositions.","Anderson et al. 2006; Rintamaki et al. 2007; Ulaga and Eggert 2006;Payne, A., et al., 2017, p. 472."

SH0001,"Business model innovation matters to managers, entrepreneurs and academic researchers for several reasons. First, it represents an often underutilized source of future value. Second, competitors might find it more difficult to imitate or replicate an entire novel activity system than a single novel product or process.

SH0003,"Two phases are critical for firms’ BMI. The first is the design phase, in which firms discover, create, and select a new business model based on their (and their stakeholders’) goals, templates from their current or other industries, stakeholders they could or plan to involve in the businesses, and their environmental constraints. The second is the operation phase, in which firms exploit and adapt their innovative business models to create and capture value together with their external stakeholders.","Amit et. al., 2019, p. 8."

SH0005,"We formally define the business model as the system of independent activities that are performed by a focal firm and by its partners and it mechanisms that link these activities to each other.An activity in a focal firms' business model can be viewed as the engagement of human, physical, and/or capital resources of any party to the business model (the focal firm, end customers, vendors, etc. to serve a specific purpose toward the fulfillment of the overall objective.An activity system is a set of interdependent and interconnected activities that are centered on a focal firm; it encompasses activities that are conducted either by the focal firm or by partners, customers, or vendors.","Amit & Zott, 2021, p. 13."
SH0006,"To fully address a market opportunity, a firm's business model (a.k.a activity system) many transcend the focal firm and span across the firm and its industry boundaries, but it remains centered on a focal firm, enabling the focal firm not only to create value with its partners through the activities they perform, but also to appropriate a share of the value created. The firm's revenue model plays an important role in value appropriation.","Amit & Zott, 2021, p. 14."
SH0007,"One of the most important skills needed to become a good business model designer is the ability to think holistically about your firm's current or future business model. This ability to ""see the big picture"" will allow you to conceptualize and innovate at a system level. Adopting a design-oriented business mother mindsets, you will be equipped to design a firm that is ready to meet expected future trends (for example, in technology).","Amit & Zott, 2021, p. 22."

SG005,"Business model innovation differs from instrumental innovations (e.g. in processes or
products) in that it is a more systems-oriented approach, aiming at deliberate changes to
how companies create value (Wirtz et al., 2016). As a consequence, business model

SG008,"The concepts of BM, BMI, and its relationship with internationalization and entry modes are investigated in this paper. Based on the literature review, a theoretical model is proposed to relate entry modes and the need of business model innovation. The global market can be considered a volatile environment and the internationalization of a firm through the adoption of any entry mode may lead to the need to innovate or adapt its business model (BM) to better fit specific contexts of international markets.

Specifically, agreements must be formulated on how costs and revenues will flow under defined operating conditions and in various scenarios. In essence, such a mechanism defined the governance structure that will facilitate a smoothly operating outcome-based service. During this phase, value-capture activities became more quantifiable and concrete as operational routines were fleshed out.

PP0005,"The paradigm shift towards considering the significance of data as a strategic resource as well as an external view with inter-organizational data sharing are phenomena that just begin to gain research attention in the context of data governance. The rise of ecosystems underlines the need to review data governance from an inter-organizational perspective, as novel forms of collaboration between various actors lack concepts in enforcing governance mechanisms for data and challenge established practices. The dynamics within ecosystems are more complicated and diverse because value-creation processes, governance and ownership structures over data become less transparent.","Lis & Otto, 2020, p.1"

Although SMEs can derive scaling benefits from expansion both within their national market and across national boundaries, the latter is likely to provide them with more benefits. By expanding across borders, they can gain access to new markets, achieve economies of scale and scope, engage in beneficial learning opportunities, and utilize low-cost factor inputs, all relevant aspects in business model scaling.

PP0009,"Customer relationships are crucial for the internationalization of SMEs. Efficient customer relationship management contributes to business growth, and that scaling requires deep engagement and communications with customers. Specifically, scaling companies need to track and align their value propositions to customers and communicate both internally and externally to deliver high value to customers before, during, and after they use products or consume services. Growth firms emphasize personalized contacts with customers and aim at improving customer satisfaction, rather than reducing costs.","Westerlund, 2020, p.51"

Scalability may require finding new distribution channel partners and outsourcing non-core technology development or service provision to third parties. Digital technologies enable integration and connectivity with third-party services that are provided by global value network partners through application programming interfaces. A SME’s “digital networking capability” becomes of ultimate importance for its growth; in other words, SMEs need to co-create value with various digitally connected partners.","Westerlund, 2020, p.52"

New actors arise and the role of existing ones is changing. As a consequence, new ways of creating and offering value through ecosystems that goes beyond individual value chains are raising. Accordingly, traditional manufacturing companies oriented to product sales, feel increasingly compelled to revise their existing Business Models in response to new competitive dynamics and to tap into those Industry 4.0 inspired opportunities","Ibarra et al., 2018 p7"
KI0007,"This context opens up inroads to make manufacturing more responsive to user-driven design and to align it better with customer value creation processes and contexts. From this approach, companies need to develop new capabilities in both, learning more about their customers (using digital capabilities to obtain information about customers, promoting evidence-based decision making, developing integral customer experiences, etc.) and becoming more of an ecosystem beyond individual value chains (become great at building partnerships with new stakeholders). Thus, the Industry 4.0 provides opportunities to create new and more flexible value propositions to respond to customer demands such as the provision of individualized products and even batch-size-line production.

Based on the research gap we have formulated a research question and broke it down into five sub-questions. These research questions aim to generate descrip- tive knowledge about the process organisations undergo to move into new, sustainable business models, both in the start-up and corporate context. While this comprises the development of an entirely new business model from scratch in the context of start- ups, it describes the transformation from one business model to another, the acquisition and integration of new business models, or the process of business model diversification in a corporate setting","Geissdoerfer et al., 2018 p 410"

By this way, the focal firm’s value creation process is linked with the stakeholders’ processes. Moving from value chains to ecosystems and, in consequence, increasing stakeholders’ knowledge, requires a radical change in many of the Business Model elements (key activities, channels and relationships) with both customer and partnerships. As a result, new ways of capturing value should be defined too.","Ibarra et al., 2018 p9"
GS0001,"Companies with disruptive value propositions target emerging customer segments rooted in low-end or new markets. Hence, companies continuously innovate their value propositions to move upmarket and attract an increasing share of the mainstream market.. Market disruption occurs when the business model’s value proposition is brought into the mainstream market. Thus, DI is a market-side phenomenon related to how appealing a value proposition is initially to niche customers, and how a company is able to continuously innovate the value proposition to attract larger shares from mainstream customer segments.","Schmidt & Scaringella, 2020 p. 3"
GS0002,"It is prudent to focus specifically on value propositions because it has been demonstrated that they have been successfully developed and communicated by less than 10% of companies (Frow & Payne, 2011), indicating the extent of their untapped potential. The development of value propositions is associated with innumerable benefits, especially in a servitization setting that demands new capabilities and management practices. In practice, servitization is fundamentally about changing seller- and product-based value propositions to customer- and service-based proposals.","Saki-Gyinae & Holmlund, 2018 p.2"
GS0003,"Building on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the extant literature suggests that value propositions can form a hierarchy with economic value propositions at the most fundamental level, followed by functional, emotional, and, finally, symbolic value propositions. Economic value propositions aim to appeal to consumers through price-based value, which is defined as the lowest price among competitive offerings or the best trade-off between benefits and sacrifices. Functional value propositions appeal to consumers with promises of functional, utilitarian, or physical product performance and benefits that can solve consumers’ problems in efficient, effective, and convenient ways. Emotional value propositions aim to arouse positive feelings and affective states in consumers. And symbolic value propositions promise consumers to deliver positive consumption meanings, whether personal or social. In other words, self-expression, social value, and the meanings behind consumption are major drivers of consumption behavior.","Yi et al., 2020 p. 788"
GS0004,"A value proposition reflects the overall objective of a Business Model (BM) and orchestrates other BM components to create, deliver, and capture value.

GS0009,"The concept of a “customer value proposition” is indigenous to marketing. The term “value proposition” was originally conceived as a proposition for customers, thus, in our view, it clearly comes from marketing.

MB0002,"Four basic elements underlie a structuralist approach to ecosystems. Collectively they characterize the configuration of activities and actors required for a value proposition to materialize. Activities, which specify the discrete actions to be undertaken in order for the value proposition to materialize. Actors, which are the entities that undertake the activities. A single actor may undertake multiple activities; conversely, multiple actors may undertake a single activity. Positions, which specify where in the flow of activities across the system actors are located and characterize who hands off to whom. Links, which specify transfers across actors. The content of these transfers can vary—matériel, information, influence, funds. Critically, these links need not have any direct connection to the focal actor.","Adner, 2017, p.39"
MB0003,"The main theoretical premise for ecosystem research is the simultaneous presence of complementarities and interdependencies between actors. Complementarities between actors stem from the fact that the functions performed by their respective offers help to create or enhance the user value proposition. Interdependencies between actors stem from the fact that their offers are connected within a system-level architecture. While complementarities represent an economic relationship between offers in terms of the potential for value creation, interdependencies represent a structural relationship between offers in terms of how they are connected for the value to be created and how a change in one offer may affect the contribution of other offers towards value creation.","Kapoor, 2018, p.1"
MB0004,"A key aspect of research on ecosystems is to identify the bottlenecks in the ecosystem stemming from innovations in technologies and business models and to illustrate how they impact firms (Adner and Kapoor 2016; Kapoor and Furr 2015). It is also important to consider how firms may allocate resources to resolve bottlenecks in their ecosystems through R&D investments, alliances, or even integration into the activities underlying the bottleneck component (Ethiraj 2007 Adner and Kapoor 2016; Hannah 2016; Zobel et al. 2017). Other strategic choices entail choosing markets or technologies where bottlenecks are either relatively easily resolvable or where firms’ control over the bottleneck component may provide it with a source of rents (Baldwin 2018b). Finally, an important implication of the existence of bottlenecks in an ecosystem is that firms would need to develop architectural knowledge not only at the level of the product (Henderson and Clark 1990) but also at the level of the ecosystem. Such knowledge can enable firms to recognize bottlenecks and can provide an important source of competitive advantage as evidence through Edison’s success with electric lighting (Hughes 1993).","Kapoor, 2018, p.1"
MB0005,"Many ecosystems are organized around a central platform-based architecture that serves as a foundation for firms to offer complementary products or services. There are several important differences between a product-based and a platform-based ecosystem. Platform-based ecosystems are orchestrated by the owner of the platform, who creates the platform architecture and sets the rules for complementors to participate in the ecosystem (e.g., Gawer and Cusumano 2002; McIntyre and Srinivasan 2017; Baldwin, 2018d). Accordingly, the alignment structure between the platform firm and the complementors is determined by the platform owner. In contrast, the alignment structure between the product firm and complementors is typically mutually determined.","Kapoor, 2018, p.1"
MB0006,"The activities, actors, positions, and links are stable; to the extent that there is change, it is at the level of individual actors or dyads (e.g., new products launched through established channels; rivalry among actors in the same positions) rather than affecting the structural alignment of multilateral positions. In such settings, the ecosystem has the taken-for-granted character of routine-as-truce (i.e., Nelson & Winter, 1982). It is when innovation requires a change in the configuration of these elements that the ecosystem becomes apparent and where consideration of ecosystem dynamics becomes critical for crafting and understanding strategy.","Adner, 2017, p.39"
MB0007,"As all of this suggests, a strong partnering capability is required to successfully grow digital ecosystems. This capability must be designed to support digital partnering, which is not the same as the traditional handshake and bespoke partnering of the physical world. Traditional partnering often includes exclusive relationships, long-term contracts, and deep integrations, all of which take time to establish and require strategic commitment. Digital partnering creates growth by adding more products and customers via digital connections with other companies that enable fast response to customer needs. It requires the ability to determine and agree with partners about who will create value, how revenue will be apportioned, and what data will be shared; it also requires the capacity to quickly add partners’ products and services via plug-and-play connections that offer immediate order and payment processing, and sometimes delivery as well.","Sebastian et al., 2020, p. 58"
MB0008,"a critical strategic choice for complementors is whether to specialize in one particular platform ecosystem or leverage multiple platforms. Conventional wisdom, and much of the literature on multihoming—that is, the decision of complementors to participate in one or multiple platform ecosystems (e.g., Bresnahan et al., 2015b; Landsman and Stremersch, 2011)—would suggest that complementors should exploit the market opportunities as much as possible; hence, they should expand their market reach across platform ecosystems and product spectrums to benefit from economies of scale. Other scholars have also advanced that complementor firms can obtain benefits from economies of scope by leveraging shared resources to increase the variety of product offerings across different product categories (Yoo et al., 2010; Tiwana, 2015). However, opposing findings highlight the potential trade-offs of product design (co)specialization that complementors face when choosing to develop their products for multiple platform ecosystems (Cennamo et al., 2018). Indeed, these trade-offs raise questions of whether and to what extent complementors should expand the scale and scope of their product offerings within and across platform ecosystems.","Tavalaei et al., 2021, p.101994"
MB0009,"Our analysis reveals that complementors face a trade-off regarding their scale- and scope-enhancement strategies: they are better off either specializing in one product category and exploiting potential economies of scale across multiple platform ecosystems or specializing in one platform ecosystem and exploiting potential economies of scope by expanding their product offerings across multiple product categories. In other words, for optimal performance, complementors should increase their investments and efforts within a specific product category and expand its scale across various platform ecosystems—what we call “category specialization”—or they should increase their investments and efforts within a single platform ecosystem while achieving scope benefits across various product categories in that platform ecosystem—what we call “platform ecosystem specialization.”","Tavalaei et al., 2021, p.101994"
MB0010,"Designed ecosystems like Nespresso's are increasingly important, owing to the convergence of three big structural changes in our economy. The first is an unprecedented rollback of regulations protecting firms that once had the exclusive privilege of serving particular customer needs. As those protections fall, organizations in other domains are free to partner to provide more-integrated offerings, as when accountancies team up with law firms. The second change is a blurring of the separation between products and services because of regulatory changes and digitization. The latter has also led to offerings with more-modular structures whose components can be recombined in new ways, which in turn has encouraged the rise of product-service bundles provided by networks of interdependent suppliers. The third change involves technology that is revolutionizing how firms can serve their customers. Our dependence on mobile devices, along with the internet's influence on buying patterns, has dramatically expanded the possibilities for linking previously unrelated goods and services -- reinforcing the effects of the first two changes.","Jacobides, 2019, p.128"

A first key activity is implementing a modular approach to scaling. A key revenue model challenge for the firms we studied were that most advanced digital services are not easily upscaled, i.e., sold to many different customers, due to the need for high degrees of customization. As a response, firms need to work with core modules that can be adapted to various local contexts.

Complementarity influences the size of the value to be bargained over (some combinations yield higher value, others lower value, depending on their “fit”).

Given that innovation activities include R&D, engineering, design, and other creative work (OECD, 2018, p.1.), functional interdependence is the interconnectedness of various activities in the same location (Teece, 2014, p.1.).

Moreover, for the new firm to commercialise its technology (product or service), several components need to function together (Dmitriev et al., 2014). For example, founders need to identify customer segments and their needs, determine the benefits of using the firm’s technology, and identify and confirm revenue streams to capture value (Magretta, 2002; Teece, 2010). Several components of a business model have been discussed and elaborated on by extant research. However, the ones most discussed are linked to how firms create, deliver, and capture value (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002; Osterwalder et al., 2005; Teece, 2010). These models include the value proposition, customer segment and relationships, distribution channels, partner networks, key resources and assets, and revenue and cost structures. The value proposition is centred as the ‘heart’ of the business model with customer-related activities and revenues as front-office activities, and resources, partners, and costs as back-office activities.

After the implementation of such a system, the consumers’ satisfaction with custom-made apparel bought online should be investigated based on several factors (e.g. personal characteristics,fashion involvement, body satisfaction, purchase behavior, general attitude towards novelties with an emphasis on new technologies).(ŽURAJ et al. 2017, p.10)."," Žuraj, M., Šparl, P. and Žnidaršič, A., 2017.

KP0008,"Furthermore, because of apparel size differences between companies, comparing body and apparel size will help to prevent faults against other systems, which use previously purchased apparel size. However, the success of this system is directly related with true body and apparel sizes and
how to measure all parts must be explained clearly either for users or for companies. It is believed that these new methods aid to a find an alternative way to solve one of the biggest problems in apparel online marketing.(Hernandez et al. 2019, p.13).","Hernández, N., Mattila, H. and Berglin, L. 2019. Can Virtually Trying on Apparel Help in Selecting the Correct Size? Clothing and Textiles Research Journal. 37(4), pp.249–264."
RZ0001,"It is established that over 60% of construction company failures worldwide have their roots traced to financial issues, which affect their profitability status (Majer et al., 2020). According to Zhu et al. (2019), most of these
construction projects fail to achieve their expected profits because of the difficulties in
managing certain risks in a more complex web of project organisation. Profitability is,
therefore classified as one of the most obvious causes of insolvency in the construction
industry (Arditi et al., 2000).(Adinyira et al., 2021).","Adinyira et al., 2021, pp.1491–1514."
RZ0002,"Due to the specific characteristics of real estate markets such as low transparency, information asymmetry, illiquidity as well as long transaction periods, one could argue that real estate is by nature more prone to sentiment than stock markets, for example. (Tchuente and Nyawa, 2021)","Hausler et al., 2018, pp.344–371."
RZ0003,"Buying a house is the largest financial transaction for most households (Pedersen et al.
2013), knowing the real value of a home is a major asset in more ways than one and allows
the buyer to not only distinguish between good and bad deals but also to be able to effectively
negotiate the price of the property during the transaction. On the seller’s side, the
precise estimate of the price of his/her home before it goes on sale allows him/her to know
its exact market value.(Tchuente and Nyawa, 2021)

RZ0004,"Looking at firm level, companies can use the
applied methodologies in order to gain insights about market sentiment prevailing
after reporting company news, publishing a new strategy or releasing a new product.
Thus, understanding the extraction of sentiment from textual documents provides
market participants and researchers with a flexible and adjustable tool that is both
directly related to the asset class and quicker as well as easier to replicate as, e.g.
topic-specific surveys.(Hausler, Ruscheinsky and Lang, 2018)

RZ0005,"Support Vector Regression Algorithm will serve to prompt or warn contractors before the commencement and during the execution of projects about profit performance. The SVRA model aid contractors to predict profit on completion before the commencement of projects. This will equip contractors seeking to enhance profit by helping them make informed and objective decisions towards the maximization of profit. It will provide contractors with relevant signals on the influence of any change in the significant variables used in the determination of profit because of the client (variations or payment issues), or the contractor (labor-management).(Adinyira et al., 2021)","Adinyira et al., 2021, pp.1491–1514."
RZ0006,"Data are the first step in advancing our understanding of real estate and enabling effective use of ML. Without sources of clean, structured data, it is impossible to train models and get insights. ML is an effective tool used in structuring data and aggregating various information sources, a task that has proven to be a roadblock for many real estate companies in the past. These data include traffic information, sales reports, revenue statistics, location information, and customer demographics (LocateAI, Inc. 2018). The users of these data may be the technology firms themselves, who leverage the information to improve their platforms for users. Others may sell the data as a service to their clients, who might be investors, lenders, and other professionals in the industry.(Viriato, 2019)","Viriato, 2019, pp.43–54."
RZ0007,"Despite the benefits of machine learning for prediction, its contribution to the processes
of inference is virtually nil. According to Mullainathan and Spiess (2017), machine learning
addresses the needs of prediction, but most applications in economics revolve around the
estimation and interpretation of the parameters of the model. Athey (2018) is consistent
with this, pointing out that causal inference is typical in the economics literature, but that
machine learning does not address the needs of estimation. Overcoming this limitation is
crucial in the context of real estate, since the interpretation of the obtained function, the
identification of the most important variables, and the estimation of the marginal effects,
among other things, are fundamental topics for the generation of knowledge and economic
decision making.(Pérez-Rave, Correa-Morales and González-Echavarría, 2019)

RZ0008,"When ML and AI are used improperly, the results can be undesirable. Unfortunately, several of the firms interviewed noted that it can be hard in today’s competitive world of computing to find good data scientists.15 The chief executive officer (CEO) of Leverton, Abhinav Somani, stated that companies are probably experiencing challenges applying ML and AI because it takes specialists, and it is best to hire PhDs and high-caliber professionals with hands-on experience in developing scalable solutions. He also noted that real estate technology and other start-ups may have trouble hiring from these specialized talent pools when competing with major companies. Successful real estate technology firms must find good talent to help avoid common pitfalls of ML.(Viriato, 2019)","Viriato, 2019, pp.43–54."
