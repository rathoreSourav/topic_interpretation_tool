While working on many projects (one being a 1956 Chris Craft), I've not had time to work on the 1959 Chris Craft Capri. I need it out of storage to allow someone that has time and wants to restore this beautiful boat. I have all the original parts, papers and pieces. Plus, I have two engines. The original 283 and another 283 pulled from my 1961 Christ Craft sold 10 years back. There is damage to the left front side due to a trailering accident when moved to Texas from Arkansas. However, for a wooden boat enthusiast, it should not be a problem since the boat needs to be restored. When completed, it will be an amazing/one-of-a-kind boat. Now, I was told it was the last 1959 Capri of this model when I purchased (last of 65 with a hull number of CP-18-065).Post Free ListingSearch Free Boat ListingsCopyright 2022.
