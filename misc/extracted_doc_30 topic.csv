Moreover, for the new firm to commercialise its technology (product or service), several components need to function together (Dmitriev et al., 2014). For example, founders need to identify customer segments and their needs, determine the benefits of using the firm’s technology, and identify and confirm revenue streams to capture value (Magretta, 2002; Teece, 2010). Several components of a business_model have been discussed and elaborated on by extant research. However, the ones most discussed are linked to how firms create, deliver, and capture value (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002; Osterwalder et al., 2005; Teece, 2010). These models include the value_proposition, customer segment and relationships, distribution channels, partner networks, key resources and assets, and revenue and cost structures. The value_proposition is centred as the ‘heart’ of the business_model with customer-related activities and revenues as front-office activities, and resources, partners, and costs as back-office activities.

Demil and Lecocq (2010) highlights three core components of a process driven business_model, namely, resources and competencies, organizational structure, and propositions for value delivery. Changes within or between these components may impact the model hence making it a dynamic ‘organism’ with the propensity for change signalled by changes in the inter-relational and intra-relational components of the model. Demil and Lecocq (2010) thus conclude that anticipating and reacting to the ‘consequences of evolution in any given component’ is a capability crucial to build and maintain sustainable firm performance."

A key revenue_model challenge for the firms we studied were that most advanced digital services are not easily upscaled, i.e., sold to many different customers, due to the need for high degrees of customization. As a response, firms need to work with core modules that can be adapted to various local contexts.

Complementarity influences the size of the value to be bargained over (some combinations yield higher value, others lower value, depending on their “fit”).

machine_learning does not address the needs of estimation. Overcoming this limitation is

Another distinct feature of scaling strategies is that, compared to high growth in mature firms, which typically deal with path dependencies and rigidities while attempting to grow (Sirmon et al., 2011), scaling firms need to deal with a sense of turmoil, chaos, and great inefficiencies while growing. This is because the internal organization of scaling firms is neither well developed nor cost-optimized (DeSantola and Gulati, 2017; Sullivan, 2016), and there are limits for an organization to learn from prior experience if resource development is compressed in time (Dierickx and Cool, 1989)."

In addition, a cost efficiency analysis of such a system should be conducted from both the consumers’ and the manufacturers’ perspectives. After the implementation of such a system, the consumers’ satisfaction with custom-made apparel bought online should be investigated based on several factors (e.g. personal characteristics,fashion involvement, body satisfaction, purchase behavior, general attitude towards novelties with an emphasis on new technologies).(ŽURAJ et al. 2017, p.10)."

The first is an unprecedented rollback of regulations protecting firms that once had the exclusive privilege of serving particular customer needs. As those protections fall, organizations in other domains are free to partner to provide more-integrated offerings, as when accountancies team up with law firms. The second change is a blurring of the separation between products and services because of regulatory changes and digitization. The latter has also led to offerings with more-modular structures whose components can be recombined in new ways, which in turn has encouraged the rise of product-service bundles provided by networks of interdependent suppliers. The third change involves technology that is revolutionizing how firms can serve their customers. Our dependence on mobile devices, along with the internet's influence on buying patterns, has dramatically expanded the possibilities for linking previously unrelated goods and services -- reinforcing the effects of the first two changes."
