If you accept your offer, a hard inquiry is made. This may impact your credit score. If your application is declined or you reject your offer, your credit score isn't impacted by the soft inquiry associated with your application.If your application was declined, learn what you can do to try and improve your next application.If you're combining accounts for Apple Card Family, some of the credit factors mentioned above may be considered for both co-owners when evaluating a combined credit limit for a co-owned Apple Card.2Personal finance companies, like Credit Karma, might display various credit scores, like TransUnion VantageScore.
