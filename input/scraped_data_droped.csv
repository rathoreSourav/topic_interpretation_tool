Compare Products Press Enter to submit Tap to search Wear & Care We design and build our products with the goal that you never want to take them off. Even so  for the best experience  it is important to follow the guidelines outlined here as you wear and care for our products. It is important to get the right fit so that the sensors in our products can do their jobs. These guidelines  the materials used in our products  and our safety standards and protocols  have been chosen and developed in collaboration with leading experts in the field and our 10+ years of experience in building wearables. We select our materials through a rigorous evaluation and testing process beyond what existing regulations require. This is all in an effort to deliver you products that help you live an active  healthier life while keeping your wrist happy. Give Your Wrist a Rest If you experience any discomfort or irritation  loosen the band  and if it persists give your wrist a break by taking your device off. In general  it is always important to give your wrist a rest on a regular basis by removing the device for an hour or so after extended wear. A great time to do this is while you are showering. Even though it is ok to shower with our water resistant products  not doing so reduces the potential for exposure to soaps  shampoos  and conditioners  which can cause long-term damage to the product and may cause skin irritation. Additionally  keep in mind that if you have eczema  allergies  asthma or other skin sensitivities  you may be more likely to experience skin irritation from a wearable device. Remember  if you start to experience any skin irritation or other discomfort on your wrist or in your hand  such as redness  soreness  tingling  numbness  burning or stiffness  remove your device. If any of those symptoms persist  please contact our customer support and consider contacting a dermatologist. Click here for more info on wearing our products. Don't Wear It Too Tight Make sure your band isn’t too tight. Wear the band loosely enough that it can move back and forth on your wrist. During exercise  try moving the band higher on your wrist (2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone) to get a better fit so it’s secure  but not too tight. Our heart rate sensors work best when they maintain contact with your skin. Lower the band on your wrist and loosen it after exercise. As always  if you experience any discomfort  loosen the band  and if it persists give your wrist a break by taking it off. Click here for more info on wearing our products. Keep It Clean and Dry Regularly clean your band and wrist—especially after working out  sweating or washing your hands. Do not use hand soap  body soap  dish soap  hand sanitizers  cleaning wipes  household cleaners or other similar cleaning products to clean the band or device  as those are difficult to remove and could get trapped beneath the band and irritate your skin. Instead  only use fresh water and a soap-free cleanser (like Cetaphil) to clean the band. Furthermore  to minimize the potential for damage to your product and the chance for skin irritation  avoid any direct contact with sunscreen or insect repellent sprays. Always remove your device while applying these types of creams or sprays. Keep in mind that some of our accessory bands  like those made of leather  metal and woven materials  are only intended to be worn during normal daily activity (e.g.  not during high-intensity workouts). Furthermore  while certain of our products may be water resistant or splash proof  it is always important to take it off after it gets wet and dry it well before putting it back on. Click here for more info on how to keep our products clean and here for more info on the water resistance of our products . Skin Sensitivities Despite all our efforts a small number of people may experience a reaction to certain materials. This is typically due to eczema  allergies  or other skin sensitivities  which can become worse when irritants like sweat or soap get trapped beneath the band and irritate the skin. If you know you have any skin sensitivities  be aware that our products may contain the following materials: • Nickel. Our products may contain some nickel. However  they all fall below the strict nickel restrictions set by the European REACH regulation. Therefore  while nickel exposure is unlikely to cause a reaction  you should be aware of the possibility in case you're susceptible to nickel-related reactions. • Acrylates. Our products may contain trace amounts of acrylates and methacrylates from adhesives used in those products. While these are found in many consumer products that come in contact with the skin some people may be sensitive to them. Therefore  we work to ensure our products adhere to rigorous design specifications and meet extensive test requirements so as to minimize the potential for reaction to these adhesives. Third Party Accessory Bands Accessory bands from third parties may not fit properly and may contain materials that cause skin sensitivities or other health concerns. For best results  use only Fitbit branded or Fitbit authorized accessory b ands . Get the inside scoop on all things Fitbit. Enter your email address Oops!

Pixels collect information about your browser or device and can set cookies. Local storage allows data to be stored locally on your browser or device and includes HTML5 local storage and browser cache. SDKs are blocks of code provided by our partners that may be installed in our mobile applications. SDKs help us understand how you interact with our mobile applications and collect certain information about the device and network you use to access the application. OUR USE OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES Below are the ways that we and our partners use these technologies on our Services. CATEGORY OF USE PURPOSE OF THE USE Preferences To help us remember your settings and preferences  like your preferred language or the country you are in  so that we can provide you with a more personalized experience.

Compare Products Press Enter to submit Tap to search Track  unpack and manage stress Use your Fitbit to understand your stress—learn and practice techniques that help you manage its impacts on your well-being. What is stress? It’s the body's natural response to imbalance. Stress can help your body react or adjust to situations  but too much of it over time can take a toll on health. Fitbit helps you track your body’s physical and emotional responses to stress and equips you with tools & techniques to manage them. Types of stress Acute stress Short-term stress is brought on by immediate perceived threats  like a deadline or alarm. Bursts of stress can help you motivate  focus  perform and respond quickly. Acute stress generally occurs and ends quickly making it one of the most common and least damaging types of stress. Chronic stress Prolonged stress can contribute to health problems like high blood pressure  heart disease  obesity and more. The physical and emotional effects of chronic stress can be kept at bay through awareness and lifestyle changes. Physical indications of stress EDA sensors  plus heart rate  heart rate variability and skin temperature tracking  help your Fitbit track physical indications of stress.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. You agree that any dispute between you and Fitbit arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service  the Fitbit Service  or any other Fitbit products or services (collectively  “Disputes”) will be governed by the arbitration procedure outlined below. Governing Law: Except as otherwise required by applicable law  the Terms of Service and the resolution of any Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Informal Dispute Resolution: We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Fitbit  you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting us at our mailing address in the Contact Us section of the Terms below  and providing us with your email address. We'll try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting you through email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days after submission  you or Fitbit may bring a formal proceeding. We Both Agree To Arbitrate: You and Fitbit agree to resolve any Disputes through final and binding arbitration  except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate: You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting optout@fitbit.com within 30 days of first accepting these Terms of Service and stating that you (include your first and last name) decline this arbitration agreement. Arbitration Procedures: The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work  San Francisco  California  or any other location we agree to. Arbitration Fees: The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Fitbit will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75 000. Fitbit will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate: Either you or Fitbit may assert claims  if they qualify  in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Fitbit products or Fitbit Service  or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example  trademark  trade secret  copyright or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. No Class Actions: You may only resolve Disputes with Fitbit on an individual basis  and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class  consolidated  or representative action. Class arbitrations  class actions  private attorney general actions  and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed under our agreement.

Your Subscription term may vary  for example  with monthly or annual automatic renewal terms (a “Subscription Term”)  as described in the course of your transaction.

At any time for any reason  we may provide a refund  discount  or other consideration (“credits”) to some or all of our users. The amount and form of such credits  and the decision to provide them  are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances  nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future. Free Trials. From time to time  we may offer free trials of certain Subscriptions for specified periods of time without payment. If we offer you a free trial  the specific terms of your free trial will be provided in the marketing materials describing the particular trial. Once your free trial ends  we (or our third-party payment processor) will begin billing your designated payment method on a recurring basis for your Subscription (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) for as long as your Subscription continues  unless you cancel your Subscription prior to the end of your free trial. Instructions for canceling your Subscription are described in the sections above. To avoid any charges  you must cancel your Subscription before the end of your free trial period.

Please note that if you accept a promotional offer or make changes to your Paid Services  the amount billed may vary. It may also fluctuate due to changes in applicable taxes or currency exchange rates. You authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the corresponding amount. 5. REPRESENTATIONS  WARRANTIES  AND COVENANTS Any Paid Services are personal to you and may not be used by any other person.

For warranty issues related to those products  please contact that manufacturer.

ORDERING  SHIPPING AND DELIVERY We may refuse or cancel any order or limit any order quantity in our sole discretion  even after receiving your order. We may also require additional qualifying information prior to accepting or processing your order. While it is our practice to confirm orders by e-mail  your receipt of an e-mail confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of your order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a product or service. If you wish to make a transaction through the Fitbit Store  you may be asked to supply certain relevant information  such as your payment and shipping information. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE ANY PAYMENT METHOD THAT YOU CHOOSE TO USE TO COMPLETE ANY SUCH TRANSACTION.

In certain regions  although we are the operator of the Fitbit Store  the products and services may be sold to you by our appointed reseller  as the seller of record  pursuant to contractual arrangements between us and the reseller. As described above  this means you have a contract with that appointed reseller for the supply of those products and services.

COMPATIBILITY You are solely responsible for determining the compatibility of the products and services with any required equipment (e.g.  ensuring that you are using a compatible mobile device).

SOFTWARE LICENSE To the extent the products ordered by you contain  consist of  or make available Fitbit software in any form  such software is licensed to you and not sold  in accordance with our Terms of Service. LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW  NEITHER FITBIT  ITS SUPPLIERS  DISTRIBUTORS  OR LICENSORS  NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING  PRODUCING  OR DELIVERING FITBIT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT  INCIDENTAL  SPECIAL  EXEMPLARY  PUNITIVE  OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES  INCLUDING LOST PROFITS  LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL  SERVICE INTERRUPTION  COMPUTER DAMAGE  OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE FITBIT PRODUCTS OR SERVICE  WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY  CONTRACT  TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE)  PRODUCT LIABILITY  OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY  AND WHETHER OR NOT FITBIT OR ITS SUPPLIER  DISTRIBUTOR  RESELLER  OR LICENSOR  OR OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING  PRODUCING  OR DELIVERING FITBIT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE  EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE  TOTAL LIABILITY OF FITBIT  OR ITS SUPPLIER  DISTRIBUTOR  RESELLER  OR LICENSOR  OR OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING  PRODUCING  OR DELIVERING FITBIT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE FITBIT PRODUCTS OR SERVICE EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID FOR YOUR APPLICABLE PURCHASE. THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN FITBIT AND YOU. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES  SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. DISPUTE RESOLUTION PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. You agree that any dispute between you and Fitbit arising out of or relating to your order via the Fitbit Store (collectively  “Disputes”) will be governed by the arbitration procedure outlined below. GOVERNING LAW Except as otherwise required by applicable law  the Terms and the resolution of any Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws principles. INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Fitbit  you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting support@fitbit.com . We'll try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting you through email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days after submission  you or Fitbit may bring a formal proceeding. WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE You and Fitbit agree to resolve any Disputes through final and binding arbitration  except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below. OPT-OUT OF AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting optout@fitbit.com within 30 days of first accepting these Terms and stating that you (include your first and last name) decline this arbitration agreement. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work  San Francisco  California  or any other location we agree to. ARBITRATION FEES The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Fitbit will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75 000. Fitbit will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. EXCEPTIONS TO AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE Either you or Fitbit may assert claims  if they qualify  in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Fitbit products or services  or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example  trademark  trade secret  copyright or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. NO CLASS ACTIONS You may only resolve Disputes with Fitbit on an individual basis  and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class  consolidated  or representative action. Class arbitrations  class actions  private attorney general actions  and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed under our agreement. JUDICIAL FORUM FOR DISPUTES Except as otherwise required by applicable law  in the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim  you and Fitbit agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County  California. Both you and Fitbit consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. We both agree to waive our right to a jury trial. LIMITATION ON CLAIMS Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary  any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your order from the Fitbit Store must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose  or else that claim or cause of action will be barred forever. GENERAL PROVISIONS The parties disclaim application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Except as otherwise stated herein  these Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between us regarding any orders you make on the Fitbit Store  and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between us relating thereto. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable  that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign  delegate  or transfer these Terms  by operation of law or otherwise  without Fitbit’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms  without such consent  will be null and void. Fitbit may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing  these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties  their successors  and permitted assigns. Any notices or other communications provided by Fitbit under these Terms  including those regarding modifications to these Terms  will be given: (i) via email to any address you have provided to Fitbit; or (ii) by posting to the Fitbit Store. For notices made by e-mail  the date on which the message is sent will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted. Fitbit’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Fitbit. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms  the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. You will not export or re-export  directly or indirectly  the products or services  or any technical information related thereto  to any destination or person prohibited or restricted by applicable law  including  without limitation  U.S. export control laws and regulations. ADDITIONAL TERMS MAY APPLY Additional terms may apply to certain products or services.

SUBSCRIPTIONS Automatically Renewing Subscriptions. Your Subscription term may vary  for example  with monthly or annual automatic renewal terms (a “Subscription Term”)  as described in the course of your transaction. Your Subscription will automatically renew for additional Subscription Terms as long as your Subscription continues  until you cancel it or we suspend or stop providing the Subscription in accordance with our Terms of Service . Unless otherwise indicated by us  you will be charged prior to  or at the beginning of  each renewal term.

Compare Products Press Enter to submit Tap to search Unlock the power of PurePulse® heart rate See how our first automatic  continuous wrist-based heart rate technology is helping you understand your heart on a new level.* Heart rate tracking made for every day In the past  heart rate tracking was expensive  awkward and uncomfortable. With the invention of PurePulse  we made it accessible to anyone. Inspired by a thimble-sized sensor used in hospitals  we conducted extensive research to make wrist-based heart rate tracking work in all types of environments. Photoplethysmography: a long word with a short explanation We use light to measure blood flow. As your heart beats  the volume of blood in your wrist rises and falls. Blood absorbs light  so a sensor shines a light onto the skin while light detectors called photodiodes measure how much light is being absorbed. The rise and fall of the absorption signal represents each heartbeat. This tells you how many times your heart is beating per minute. Innovation backed by research In a number of external studies worldwide  PurePulse® technology has surpassed industry expectations. And over 50 patents related to PurePulse technology have been awarded to Fitbit’s heart rate innovation in the process. Discover the benefits of heart rate tracking Know your zone Use heart rate zones to maintain the right intensity. Track sleep quality Use your heart rate to track sleep stages. Reach weight goals Get a more accurate measure of calories burned. Manage stress Do guided breathing sessions personalized for your heart rate. Features and tools powered by heart rate Resting Heart Rate Measure heart rate when your body’s at rest to assess your heart health and see resting heart rate trends. Heart Rate Zones Use real-time heart rate zones to understand your effort during workouts. Cardio Fitness Level Better understand how fit you are without the need for a strenuous VO2 max test.

Redefine your routine Base exercise & recovery on your body instead of a schedule. Intensity guidance Get dynamic recommendations for workouts & mindfulness. Exercise efficiently Improved recovery helps you get more out of your workouts. What is Daily Readiness Score? Daily Readiness Score uses your Fitbit data to assess whether you're ready to work out or should prioritize recovery. Over time  it will help you understand how your activity levels  sleep patterns and heart rate variability from previous days contribute to how energized you feel today. Watch this video to learn more. How is Daily Readiness Score calculated? The score compares your recent activity  sleep and heart rate variability (HRV) levels against your personal baseline. What does a high or low score mean? A high score means you’re ready for a higher-intensity workout. A low score means your body is fatigued from a tough workout  poor sleep  stress or strain on the body—or a combination of these factors. Prioritize rest & recovery on low score days. See what to expect on high- and low-score days below. Which Fitbit products work with Daily Readiness Score? Available for Fitbit Premium members using Google Pixel Watch  Sense 2  Sense  Versa 4  Versa 3  Versa 2  Charge 5  Inspire 3  Inspire 2 and Luxe. First a score  then guidance Setting you up for success Daily Readiness provides more than a score. You'll also receive personalized Active Zone Minutes goals based on your score and fitness level—then see workouts that can help you reach the next level and stretch sessions to help you recover. What gets measured—and why Activity Activity is a key ingredient for health  but long-term well-being isn’t best achieved by pushing yourself to your physical limits every day. Gauging fatigue—and taking time to rest—is critical to gaining all the benefits of your effort. Sleep Sufficient  consistent rest is a vital component to your energy levels. Your Daily Readiness Score uses your recent sleep patterns to gauge your energy levels. Heart rate variability Heart rate variability (HRV) is the variance in time between heartbeats while you're asleep. A high variability is a positive sign of readiness and will contribute to a high score. Low variability is often connected with increased stress or strain on the body  leading to less energy.

Compare Products Press Enter to submit Tap to search Check for atrial fibrillation with Fitbit Discover how Fitbit can help identify signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib) so you can have a better conversation with your doctor about your heart health. Why Fitbit Why Fitbit What is AFib ECG App ♦ Irregular Heart Rhythm Notifications ♦♦ Two ways to uncover AFib  at your fingertips With the ECG app   you can take an AFib assessment on demand. Plus  use irregular heart rhythm notifications to look for signs of AFib while you’re still or sleeping. How to get these features Fitbit makes a difference Easy to use Gain insight into your heart health right from home. Rooted in research Both features were validated in clinical studies for accurate results.* FDA cleared Our AFib technologies have been FDA cleared. Doctor-ready Get results you can share with a healthcare professional. What is AFib? Atrial fibrillation is an irregular heart rhythm and occurs when the upper chambers beat out of sync with the lower chambers. This can increase risk of blood clots  stroke and heart attack. Adults over 40 have a 1 in 4 risk of developing AFib in their lifetime.** AFib is treatable  so the earlier you identify it  the sooner you can do something about it. Why it's hard to diagnose With AFib  the heart may not always beat irregularly  making it hard to detect  even in a doctor’s office. Palpitations and shortness of breath can be symptoms of AFib  but some people don’t have any symptoms. Where Fitbit comes in To check for signs of AFib  use the Fitbit ECG app to assess your heart rhythm on demand or have Fitbit analyze it while you’re still or sleeping. Armed with this information  you can connect with your healthcare provider and have a more informed discussion. Check on demand with the ECG app An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is a test that measures your heart’s electrical activity. Fitbit’s ECG app records those electrical signals and looks for signs of AFib. To take a heart rhythm assessment  set up the ECG feature in the Fitbit app. ♦ Watch Sense video Watch Charge 5 video Look for signs of AFib over time With Irregular Heart Rhythm Notifications   Fitbit analyzes your heart rhythm while you’re still or sleeping and looks out for potential signs of AFib. ♦♦ Set up notifications How to get these features Irregular heart rhythm notifications are available in the following countries: American Samoa ᐧ Australia ᐧ Austria ᐧ Belgium ᐧ Canada ᐧ Chile ᐧ Czech Republic ᐧ France ᐧ Germany ᐧ Guam ᐧ Hong Kong ᐧ Iceland ᐧ Ireland ᐧ Italy ᐧ Liechtenstein ᐧ Luxembourg ᐧ Malta ᐧ Mauritius ᐧ Netherlands ᐧ New Zealand ᐧ Norway ᐧ Poland ᐧ Portugal ᐧ Puerto Rico ᐧ Romania ᐧ Singapore ᐧ South Africa ᐧ Spain ᐧ Sweden ᐧ Switzerland ᐧ United Kingdom ᐧ United States ᐧ U.S. Virgin Islands ᐧ Vietnam This feature is compatible with Sense 2  Sense  Versa 4  Versa 3  Versa 2  Versa Lite  Charge 5  Charge 4  Charge 3  Luxe  Inspire 3 and Inspire 2.
