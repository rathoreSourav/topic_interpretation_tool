Roche Canada Ltd.,https://www.rochecanada.com/en/covid-19.html,"You are here:Healthcare professionals visit our gated pageAs an integral part of the healthcare ecosystem, we are closely monitoring the global SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. Roche Canada is working proactively with partners across the healthcare industry, including patient organizations, healthcare professionals, hospitals and clinics, governments and regulatory bodies, to keep Canadians as safe as possible. We recognize our vital role in delivering critical products, including diagnostics and medicines, to Canadian patients and customers.Â We are committed to keeping you informed about our products and our approach, offering our support, and demonstrating leadership during this challenging time. We will update this page regularly as new information becomes available. If you have questions or require support please contact us.If you are a Canadian Healthcare Professional, you may access our dedicated COVID-19 page containing the latest information regarding Roche Canada products and services here.For SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Tests (for professional usage or self test), learn more here.
We are working closely with Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and each provincial public health authority to support their strategy relating to existing COVID-19 testing solutions, including those provided by Roche and according to the needs of the various regions. We are diligently providing our COVID-19 testing solutions to laboratories, public and private, and we are taking the necessary measures to help reduce the impacts of the pandemic.We have developed a growing number of diagnostic solutions that help screen, diagnose and monitor current and/or past SARS-CoV-2 virus infections in patients. Learn more here.For SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Tests (for professional usage or self test), learn more hereWith the introduction of new COVID-19 vaccines, we understand that patients and healthcare professionals may have questions on how the vaccine may impact people who are treated with Roche products, particularly whether people treated with Roche medicines should/can receive the vaccine, and how they may impact the vaccineâs efficacy.Patient safety is Rocheâs highest priority and we are closely monitoring the evolving COVID-19 situation. We are working closely with the community to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on people who are treated with Roche medicines, and will continue to share new insights as they emerge.It is important to note that over 180 vaccines are currently being developed for SARS-CoV-2 with accelerated development timelines, and a number of these vaccines use platforms for which there is no prior experience.Â We encourage patients to speak with their healthcare professional about questions related to COVID-19 vaccines and their treatment plan, or for their healthcare professional to contact us directly.
We are working proactively with all of our associated clinics to keep patients as safe as possible when receiving Roche therapy through our programs, and taking active measures to ensure the ongoing administration of our medications to all of our Canadian patients. For more information please see ourÂ Patient Assistance Program Health & Safety Update.Roche understands that many patients and their families have been financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.Â  If you are a patient who is currently enrolled in a Roche Patient Assistance Program and have lost your job or health insurance coverage due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will continue to work with both public and private payors to find solutions that ensure you have continuity of therapy, and we will close the gap when needed.Â 
Given the rapidly evolving and escalating health authority guidance and in the interests of the health and safety of their patients and staff, private infusion clinics may make the decision to close.Â  Should this occur, our vendor network will assess all impacted patients and offer an appropriate alternative setting on a priority basis. If you have questions, pleaseÂ contact the programÂ directly.We believe that an important way in which the world can win this fight is through the sharing of knowledge and healthcare data to better inform patient care and health system decision making. To help achieve this, we have assembled theÂ Data Science Coalition, a group of like-minded public and private organizations with a common mission and vision to bring actionable COVID-19 intelligence to patients, frontline healthcare providers, institutions, supply chains, and government. Together we have developed a centralized repository for publicly available data, as well as data gathered from a patient self-assessment tool, to be used to enhance COVID-19 research datasets focused on informing the management of the global pandemic.As patient level data is an important part of understanding and responding to COVID-19, the Coalition has made available a patient self-assessment tool that can be used by anyone suspected to have, or has been diagnosed (currently being treated or recovered) with COVID-19. It isÂ available to users via theÂ Health StorylinesÂ app, into which patients can report their data.Â  An anonymized COVID-19 dataset will be prepared and shared with the Roche Data Science Coalition data repository, where it will be made freely available to the research communityÂ with the aim of better informing decision making on resource allocation during this pandemic.Â The app also includes functionality allowing patients to share it with their healthcare professional, providing an overview of their symptoms and health history, which could help healthcare professionas to make more informed and efficient assessments based on the patientâs data.We deploy business continuity plans globally, across our affiliates, international headquarters and manufacturing sites, to help maintain the ongoing availability of our medications to all of our patients during public health emergencies. We have no supply constraints in Canada at this time, and have a plan in place with our logistics and transportation providers to support the uninterrupted delivery of both commercial and clinical products.Â Roche Canada is committed to working in partnership with our Canadian community to develop solutions to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. To move this forward, we have established the Roche Canada COVID-19 Innovation Challenge - a funding program to support our community in bringing forward innovative ideas to address some of the biggest challenges and issues of the COVID-19 pandemic.Â Congratulations Canada!Â  Our Challenge called on all the creative and innovative minds in Canada to bring forward solutions to address the COVID-19 pandemic.Â  Incredibly, we received over 840 high quality applications demonstrating the amazing skill and talent we have in our country. We are happy to congratulate the winners of the Roche Canada COVID-19 Open Innovation Challenge.1
As the products and services provided by Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. in Canada are essential to the Canadian healthcare system, all services will continue to operate as they currently do. For more information about businesses deemed essential services, please visitÂ Public Safety Canada - Guidance on Essential Services and Functions in Canada During the COVID-19 Pandemic.Roche is actively involved in understanding the potential of our existing portfolio. Canada recently played a role in a Phase III clinical trial studying the safety and efficacy of one of our portfolio medicines in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Similar studies are ongoing globally, where we will continue generating evidence to provide a complete understanding of COVID-19 associated moderate to severe pneumonia. Roche is also collecting and compiling data from other, independently-led clinical trials that are taking place around the world.____________________________________1.

Our aim is to achieve long-term sustainable growth and deliver value to all our stakeholders.We focus on developing innovative medicines and diagnostic tests that help patients live longer, better lives. Two-thirds of all diseases are either still not treated adequately or not treated at all. This medical need is enormous and better diagnostics and medicines can make a huge difference to the lives of millions of patients and their families. We strive to address unmet medical needs through excellence in science. Breakthroughs in science and technology increasingly allow us to find out precisely what is malfunctioning in the body and develop medicines to counter the problem. We focus on oncology, immunology, ophthalmology, infectious diseases and neuroscience, however we remain flexible and follow the science as new insights become available. We combine our strengths in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics to better fit treatments to patients. By understanding genetic differences between individuals and tailoring treatments, the efficacy and safety of medicines can be improved enormously. To this end we have a companion diagnostic strategy for molecules we develop. We aim to bring our medicines and diagnostic tests to as many people in need as possible. Every healthcare system comes with different challenges and we work with many different local partners to reduce barriers to accessing healthcare and establish innovative, sustainable ways to bring effective and affordable healthcare to patients. We are committed to constantly strengthening and maintaining an excellent workplace where every person feels valued and respected, and can grow to his or her full potential. Our people make our business. They discover, develop and manufacture our products, ensuring they reach the patients who need them.

Roche Canada Ltd.,https://www.rochecanada.com/en/r-d/partnering.html,"You are here:Addressing areas of unmet medical need through innovative Canadian partnershipsAt Roche, we believe in fostering an environment where innovation can flourish and where the patient need is at the heart of our business. We are strong believers that collaboration is the key to this commitment. Â Through partnerships, we can build a better future together with medicines and diagnostics that make a real difference to patients.We strive to work with the top scientists in the world, in a broad set of therapeutic areas, with the best tools and technologies, all with a singular goal: to help patients by enhancing our scientific drug discovery and development efforts. Partnered products account for 45% of our research pipeline and 36% of our total pharmaceutical sales.Roche has long recognized the importance of external innovation by establishing partnering groups within our R&D organizations. While we are one company pursuing a common goal of helping patients through scientific excellence, Roche and Genentech maintain independent R&D organizations served by separate business development groups. Roche Partnering, which was created more than 10 years ago, supports the Pharmaceutical Research & Early Development Â (pRED) group, while Genentech Partnering supports the Genentech Research & Early Development (gRED) group. Â Additionally, the Diagnostics Collaboration Division expands our innovation network in the area of in vitro diagnostics. Â Each R&D centre not only conducts its own development research, but has also entrenched partnering as a cornerstone of their R&D strategy in order to pursue exceptional science and to pioneer medical breakthroughs.Â Â In addition to bringing new medicines and diagnostic tests to market in Canada, Roche recognizes that we have a role to play in broader health system partnerships. Â We believe that collaboration between our organization and other research-driven institutions is critical to advancing science today and well into the future.The Roche Data Science CoalitionRoche is committed to working with the global community to develop solutions to the challenges of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. We believe that one important way in which the world can win this fight is through the sharing of knowledge and healthcare data to better inform patient care and health system decision making.Â  To help achieve this, we have assembled a group of like-minded public and private organizations with a common mission and vision to bring actionable COVID-19 intelligence to patients, frontline healthcare providers, institutions, supply chains, and government. We call ourselves the Roche Data Science Coalition, and together we have developed a centralized repository for publicly available data, as well as data gathered from a patient self-assessment tool, to be used to enhance COVID-19 research datasets focused on informing the management of the global pandemic.
As a company, we are known for exceptional science and pioneering medical breakthroughs. We bring that same innovative and entrepreneurial spirit to our partnerships. Canada is a world leader in scientific discovery and many innovative partnerships have come from Canadian institutions and companies.Roche has partnered with BC Cancer for a number of years on cutting-edge research and projects in precision medicine, onco-genomics and cancer immunotherapy. Through this relationship, weâre supporting world-leading researchers and clinicians who are integrating research and clinical expertise to advance new diagnostics and treatments for cancer patients. As the organization providing cancer care to the entire population of British Columbia, BC Cancer is recognized as a pioneer in the area of onco-genomics and is a world leader in lymphoma and leukemia research.Roche has been a key supporter of the BC Cancerâs Personalized Onco-Genomics (POG) program that is embedding genomic sequencing into diagnostic and treatment planning for patients with incurable cancers. The goal of this program is to use genomic information to direct patients towards targeted therapies whenever possible. This experimental program has served over 1,000 B.C. cancer patients impacted by 50 different types of cancer since 2014.Rocheâs strategic collaboration with Foundation Medicine, Inc. (FMI) is bringing molecular information and genomic analysis to Canadian patients. FMI provides comprehensive genomic profiling to understand a patientâs tumour, allowing a more personalized approach to cancer care by aiming to match their unique genomic profile with approved targeted therapies and novel treatments in clinical trials.
Princess Margaret Cancer Centre is one of 21 institutions partnering with Roche Â through our global cancer immunotherapy Centers of Research Excellence (imCORE) Network, representing many of the worldâs leading scientific and clinical experts in cancer immunotherapy. The goal of the imCORE Network is to rapidly initiate pre-clinical and clinical research based on the latest scientific discoveries and to aggregate, as well as share data to accelerate the search for cures for people with cancer. Through this investment, the Network focuses on identifying approaches to expand the number of people who benefit from cancer immunotherapy by exploring new ways to activate a personâs immune system to fight cancer.
Our partnership with the University of Ottawa Heart Institute and Genome Canada not only allows Roche to continue building on our understanding of cardiovascular disease, but it also has the potential to offer the medical community access to new bedside tests and novel biomarkers to offer early and accurate diagnosis.
Through our licensing and collaboration agreement with the Vancouver Prostate Centre at the University of British Columbia we are working with world leaders in the field to develop small molecules for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. This new technology is currently in pre-clinical development for use in treating prostate cancers that have become resistant to existing therapies.
We are partnering with Xenon Pharmaceuticals to discover and develop non-opioid based compounds, as well as companion diagnostics for the treatment of pain. Â Xenon is a clinical genetics-based drug discovery company engaged in the development of small molecule therapies based on the genetic causes of select metabolic, neurological and cardiovascular diseases.Weâre looking for partners! If you have an idea for collaboration or an interesting technology, or if you have an asset in one of our areas of interest, we would like to hear from you.

Roche Canada Ltd.,https://www.rochecanada.com/en/media/in-focus/january-is-cervical-cancer-awareness-month-.html,"You are here:Â It is always a good time to talk and educate ourselves about human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer.
Â ChallengeCervical cancer is one of the most preventable cancers today, thanks to vaccination, screening and early treatment. Yet, it remains the third most common cancer among Canadians with a cervix aged 25-34 years old1. Approximately 1450 Canadians are diagnosed with cervical cancer and an estimated 380 of them will die from this disease2.Unlike the majority of cancers, the main cause of cervical cancer is well known with almost all cases caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is very common3. Over 75% of Canadians will be infected by HPV at least once in their lifetime4. Most HPV infections generally show no signs or symptoms and can go away on their own, so people often donât know theyâve ever had it5. However in some Canadians, persistent high-risk HPV infection can lead to cervical precancer or cancer, although this generally happens over many years6.The elimination of cervical cancer will only come from a comprehensive, triple-intervention strategy of vaccination, advanced screening and diagnostics, and the early treatment of precancerous or cancerous lesions.Unfortunately, the lack of awareness and access to advanced diagnostic solutions is a crippling issue in the fight against cervical cancer. However, a new era of innovative technologies is transforming cervical cancer screening strategies, paving the way for improved diagnostic and early intervention solutions and accelerating the move towards personalized healthcare.Â FocusWe recognise the importance of advanced screenings and reliable diagnostic tests in cervical cancer prevention, especially knowing the critical role played by HPV â a preventable infection for which a vaccine exists â in the progression of the disease. Our scientists work tirelessly to bring new triage and diagnostic test options to patients across the world.Our latest developments in the field of biomarker technology helps identify individuals most at risk of developing cervical cancer and single out those who may need access to early intervention and treatment options from those who may not. Relying on risk-based assessments of each individual helps avoid the potential harms of over-or under-treatment.The elimination of cervical cancer can be achieved through the powerful integration of diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, data and the evolution of personalized healthcare. Having all areas of expertise under one roof, Roche is uniquely positioned to follow this holistic approach to support the WHO goal of putting all countries on the path to cervical cancer elimination by 20307.At Roche, women's health is a priority, and that starts with cervical cancer.Â Screening that mattersWhat action can someone take to protect themselves from cervical cancer?Learn more about cervical cancer, HPV, the differences in cervical cancer screening options and much more.

At Novartis Canada, we aspire to reimagine medicine and part of that includes how we are engaging with our customers. We spent the last 3 months driving over 13,500 km across 8 provinces, visiting 17 MS centres and connecting with more than 200 healthcare professionals through our cross-country roadshow.
 
In addition to engaging with our customers in new and innovative ways, we were able to provide them a glimpse into our partnership with Innodem Neurosciences and the clinical trial looking to validate how Eye Movement Biomarkers (EMBs) and Gaze Mapping Biomarkers (GMBs) could assist in monitoring disease progression in MS.

 16,194 followers(Français à suivre)Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is placing enormous strain on the Canadian health-care system, as it continues to be a leading cause of death in Canada. 
Dr. Sandeep Aggarwal, medical director Total Cardiology Rehabilitation, clinical professor at the University of Calgary, and cardiac sciences Connect Care co-chair for Alberta Health Services in Calgary, says CVD could be largely preventable through the development of sustainable secondary prevention, treatment, and care programs. But to get there, we need collaboration among health-care providers, government and industry, to develop a population health approach that overcomes clinical and socioeconomic barriers to access and support, and reduces the number of patients requiring hospital care.
 
As Helen Trifonopoulos, Vice President, Cardiovascular Health at Novartis Canada recently explained in an interview with the National Post, another vital part of the equation is identifying patients at risk for CVD, and pinpointing inequities in care and follow-up for people who have had an event and are at risk of having another.
 
For more on how a population health approach to CVD could help the Canadian health system address this crisis in Canada, read the National Post article here. 👇

La maladies cardiovasculaires (MCV) exercent une pression énorme sur le système de soins de santé canadien, car elles continuent d’être l’une des principales causes de décès au Canada. 
Le Dr Sandeep Aggarwal, directeur médical, Réadaptation cardiologique totale, professeur-clinicien à l’Université de Calgary et coprésident des soins Connect Care en sciences cardiaques pour les services de santé de l’Alberta à Calgary, affirme que les MCV pourraient être largement évitées grâce à l’élaboration de programmes durables de prévention, de traitement et de soins secondaires. Mais pour y parvenir, nous avons besoin de collaboration entre les prestataires de soins de santé, le gouvernement et l’industrie, pour développer une approche de santé de la population qui surmonte les obstacles cliniques et socioéconomiques à l’accès et au soutien, et qui réduit le nombre de patients nécessitant des soins hospitaliers.
 
Comme Helen Trifonopoulos, vice-présidente, Santé cardiovasculaire à Novartis Canada, l’a récemment expliqué lors d’une entrevue avec le National Post, un autre élément essentiel de l’équation consiste à identifier les patients à risque de MCV et cerner les inégalités dans les soins et le suivi pour les personnes qui ont subi un événement et qui sont à risque d’en avoir un autre.
 
Pour en savoir plus sur la façon dont une approche axée sur la santé de la population à l’égard des MCV pourrait aider le système de santé canadien à faire face à cette crise au Canada, lisez l’article du National Post ici. 👇

Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc.,https://www.novartis.ca/novartis-canada-responds-covid-19-commitments-key-areas-0,"As the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be felt across the country, Novartis in Canada which includes the Innovative Medicines Division (Oncology and Pharma business units) and Sandoz Canada, is focused on helping Canadians with what they need now and into the future as we adapt to life with COVID-19. Along with ensuring all of our associates in Canada remain safe and healthy so they can continue to serve patients, whether they are working remotely from home or in our essential facilities, Novartis in Canada is mobilizing to meet the COVID-19 challenge in four key areas: As a healthcare company with a strong presence and long-established roots in Canada, Novartis understands that the Canadian patients we serve – including our own friends and families – are counting on us to continue to provide the medicines they need to stay as healthy as possible and to treat serious conditions. We also need to meet the increasing demand for our products used in hospitals and are committed to meeting these crucial objectives. All Novartis manufacturing sites – including the Sandoz Canada sterile injectable manufacturing plant in Boucherville, Quebec, which makes crucial hospital products – as well as our major suppliers continue to be operational to help us deliver on our promise. We are confident in our supply chain and will continuously assess this evolving situation and adapt accordingly to continue to meet the needs of Canadians.  Novartis is also working continuously with federal and provincial governments and healthcare system partners to find solutions for patients experiencing challenges accessing treatments. One of our actions to ensure continuity of treatment is making vital cancer therapies available for patients to receive at home instead of having to go to the hospital. Part of this effort includes ensuring the nurses we work with who provide home-based care have the necessary personal protective equipment available to safely provide much needed treatments to patients in their homes. We are also ensuring that our patient support programs for those on Novartis medicines for a variety of conditions continue to be available to provide telephone and online services so patient treatment and support needs are not interrupted.  Finding solutions for difficult health challenges is a top priority. Novartis has already launched several important initiatives to contribute to the global pharmaceutical industry and government effort to find treatments and vaccines to fight COVID-19. At the same time, we are working to ensure the many important research programs we have in other disease areas are not interrupted by the pandemic. To support clinical trial continuity in Canada, where possible we are shipping study medications to patients directly to their homes to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on clinical development. In the fight against COVID-19, we have mobilized our global R&D capabilities and have initiated major new clinical trials of promising existing medications to evaluate their potential in treating COVID-19. Thanks to the great collaboration of healthcare institutions, clinicians, regulators, our manufacturing chain and our associates, initiation of these studies has been achieved with record speed with the goal of finding solutions as soon as possible to manage COVID-19.Novartis is also committed to helping as many Canadians as possible during these very challenging times. In April 2020, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. and Sandoz Canada Inc. announced the creation of the Community Strong COVID-19 response program COVID-19 response program, earmarking $500,000 to be given to community and patient groups in Canada to address the needs of Canadian patients during the pandemic. United Way Centraide Canada and Food Banks Canada have been identified as the first community organizations to receive donations through the Community Strong program. Donations will also be made to support Canadian patient organizations with COVID-19-related objectives. In addition, and to respond to the generosity of our associates to contribute to Community Strong, we have established an employee donation program with a commitment by the company to match up to $50,000 in employee donations. Novartis associates in Canada are privileged to work with the healthcare professionals who are at the front lines not just of the COVID-19 pandemic but in helping all Canadians who require care and treatment in these very challenging times. Because we see it every day, we know first-hand about the dedication and commitment of our doctors, pharmacists, nurses, technicians, and every other healthcare worker who are doing everything to help their patients stay well and get well. In recent weeks, their efforts have been more than remarkable, they have been heroic.  Every Novartis associate is committed to providing healthcare professionals we work with some of the tools and support they need to help Canadian patients. It is our way of doing what we can to help ensure that we will all get through this, together. This site is intended for an audience in Canada.

Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc.,https://www.novartis.ca/en/stories/discovery/making-history-blood-cancer-decades,"Novartis making history in blood cancer for decadesBy Daniel Hébert, Medical Head, Oncology There is no single way to treat cancer which is why our approach to tackling blood cancers is to consistently be at the cutting edge of science and working together as a team, both internally and externally. No exceptions.  2018 marked a historic moment for patients with certain blood cancers. Words like paradigm-changing and pioneering were used widely to describe the arrival of the first CAR-T therapy in Canada. CAR-T therapy harvests a patient’s own T cells and reprograms them to recognize and attack cancer cells. CAR-T therapy is a great example of how Novartis continually strives to take science further, opening our minds to all scientific possibilities. It also involves many partnerships and collaborations to make these new treatment options a reality, resulting in a meaningful difference for patients in need of an improved quality of life. It takes the involvement of investigators, government, payers, and most importantly, patients involved in research studies. Blood cancers are the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in Canada. 21 years ago, Novartis revolutionized blood cancer research when the first trial with a targeted agent transformed patient outcomes for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It changed the lives of many and became the benchmark for how we approach research. The prognosis for the once life-limiting cancer has improved considerably. CML has been transformed into a chronic condition for most and today discontinuing therapy has become a feasible treatment goal for some.Partnering with leukemia specialists and their extended teams, Novartis was instrumental in supporting the successful implementation of a standardized patient management and monitoring process across the country which now allows patients who achieve a deep and stable response to live without long-term treatment. From targeted therapies to precision cell and gene therapy and immunotherapy – we are pioneers, blazing a trail for others to follow. We are leading the way through collaborations and investments that drive research and development across all cancers while bringing expertise, scale and commitment to test new therapies for a variety of conditions.We want to be known as the company who transforms what it means to live with blood cancer or a serious blood disorder, constantly reaching for new and different endpoints. This is our desired legacy. Canadians believe in us and we believe in the promise of our innovative research and strong partnerships.NPR/ONC/0018 EThis site is intended for an audience in Canada.

“We try never to forget that medicine is for the people. It is not for the profits.”– George MerckOur legacy of inventing medicines and vaccines continues to this day. We adapt our business not only for the next quarter but for the next quarter century.
Our legacy of inventing medicines and vaccines continues to this day. We adapt our business not only for the next quarter but for the next quarter century.1890192019301940195019701980199020002010Merck & Co. was founded in the U.S. on January 1, 1891. George Merck, age 23, established the company to distribute fine chemicals throughout New York City and the neighboring areas.The first Merck Manual was published in 1899. Treatments in the first manual included bloodletting for acute bronchitis, arsenic for impotence and almond bread for diabetes. The Merck Manual went on to become one of the most widely used medical references.George Merck's son, George W. Merck, began his career in the packing and shipping department in 1914, and he received training in most branches of the business. He would lead Merck through the 1927 merger with Powers-Weightman-Rosengarten Co. and turned his attention toward building Merck's research capacity, catalyzing the company's reputation for innovation.The Merck Research Laboratory was founded in Rahway, New Jersey. The laboratory represented Merck's initial foray into pharmacological research and included three separate divisions: Pure Research, the Merck Institute for Therapeutic Research and Applied Research.Merck first synthesized vitamin B₁ and published the results in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. The development allowed for mass production of the vitamin, and within a few years, the product had contributed to the reduction of vitamin B₁ deficiency (beriberi). In subsequent years, Merck's management committed the company to isolating and synthesizing vitamins and making them more widely available.Tuberculosis was historically a leading cause of death in the U.S. In 1943, Dr. Selman Waksman and Albert Schatz discovered streptomycin, the first effective treatment for the disease. Merck supported Dr. Waksman's research lab and held the new drug's patent rights. Once its significant health benefits were recognized, Merck relinquished its exclusive patent on the antibiotic to ensure maximum patient access.By 1950, tuberculosis-related deaths in the U.S. fell by nearly 50 percent.After years of extensive testing, Merck brought S.Q. (sulfaquinoxaline) to market. The product, used to prevent coccidiosis, a parasitic poultry disease, formally ushered Merck into the field of animal health.Dr. Lewis Sarett, a researcher at Merck Research Laboratory in Rahway, developed CORTONE (cortisone). The drug was used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic fever and other related chronic diseases which were often fatal and for which there was no known effective treatment.In a defining moment for the company, George W. Merck gave a talk at the Medical College of Virginia at Richmond, during which he made a famous statement about how the medical and pharmaceutical community could be successful:""We try to remember that medicine is for the patient. We try never to forget that medicine is for the people. It is not for the profits. The profits follow, and if we have remembered that, they have never failed to appear.""This philosophy is embraced by our leaders and employees to this day.The merger brought together Merck's extensive chemical research and manufacturing facilities with Sharp & Dohme's pharmaceutical development, marketing expertise and international presence. Sharp & Dohme's West Point, Pennsylvania facilities were included in the merger.Merck established the Merck Company Foundation, a nonprofit corporation dedicated to charitable giving, with an initial contribution of $500,000. To date, the Merck Foundation has contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to nonprofit organizations.The release of DIURL (chlorothiazide) signaled the company's emergence as a leading cardiovascular company. Since the introduction of DIURIL, we have been at the forefront of developing new treatments to fight high blood pressure and heart disease. The “Diuril Man,” a transparent plastic figurine showing the heart, lungs, kidneys, ureters and bladder, helped Merck show physicians the value of the breakthrough product.In humans, trichinosis (caused by eating raw or undercooked meat) can cause high fever, muscle pain and swelling and other serious symptoms. In 1961, a Merck research team led by Dr. William Campbell discovered thiabendazole, the first drug known to kill the trichinella parasite in sheep, goat, cattle and pigs. When the reindeer populations of the Arctic Circle became severely afflicted by parasitic infections, Merck scientists traveled north to treat them with THIBENZOLE (thiabendazole), a deworming agent.The treatment not only helped protect the reindeer, but also the indigenous peoples who depended on them for survival.Merck began distributing a combined measles-mumps-rubella (M-M-R) vaccine that was developed by Drs. Maurice Hilleman and Eugene B. Buynak. M-M-R was composed of three vaccines: ATTENUVAX, an updated version of Merck's measles vaccine; MERUVAX, a rubella vaccine; and MUMPSVAX, Merck's mumps vaccine.PNEUMOVAX (pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent), Merck's pneumonia vaccine, was approved. Research and development of the vaccine was carried out under the direction of Dr. Maurice Hilleman.MEFOXIN was indicated for the treatment of many infections caused by certain bacteria, including gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.VASOTEC (enalapril), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for treatment of high blood pressure and congestive heart failure, was approved by the FDA. VASOTEC became Merck's first billion-dollar product in 1988.Merck's recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, RECOMBIVAX HB [hepatitis b vaccine (recombinant)], was approved by the FDA, the first recombinant vaccine for human use. In 1989, Merck transferred its RECOMBIVAX HB vaccine technology to the Chinese government, where hepatitis B was the largest public health challenge in the country with an estimated 100 million carriers of the disease.Merck introduced lovastatin, the first of the statin family of medicines to be approved by the FDA. It emerged from decades of study by scientists in the U.S. and abroad, at universities, independent laboratories and at Merck.In 1987, Merck CEO Dr. Roy Vagelos announced Merck's commitment to donate Mectizan - as much as needed for as long as needed - with the goal to help eliminate river blindness. In order to reach this goal, Merck leaders recognized that many organizations with unique skills would need to work together as a team. Thus, the Mectizan Donation Program (MDP) was created as a groud-breaking public-private partnership that becomes influential in the development of a number of other drug donation programs.CRIXIVAN (INDINAVIR SULFATE), for the treatment of HIV, was approved by the FDA after a review period of 42 days. Prior to the FDA approval in 1995, in conjunction with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, patients and HIV advocacy groups, Merck decided to offer the Crixivan Program. Through this program, Merck made the drug available at no cost to selective patients before it was commercially available.SINGULAIR (montelukast sodium) was approved by the FDA for the prevention and treatment of asthma. It was the product of nearly twenty years of research conducted at our Merck Frosst discovery hub in Kirkland, Canada, into a new class of asthma medicines called leukotriene blockers.The FDA approved JANUVIA (sitagliptin), a DPP-4 inhibitor approved to treat Type 2 diabetes.The FDA approved Merck's GARDASIL [human papillomavirus quadrivalent (types 6, 11, 16, 18) vaccine, recombinant] for the prevention of cervical cancer caused by certain HPV types.In 2007, Merck committed to donating 3 million doses of GARDASIL over 5 years to support vaccination programs in the world's lowest-income nations.Merck and Schering-Plough completed a merger and began combined operations. The purchase made the company the second largest pharmaceutical company in United States by revenue.In 2010, one woman died every two minutes during childbirth and pregnancy. Many of these deaths were preventable. In response, we launched Merck for Mothers, a global initiative with partners to improve the health and well-being of women before, during and after pregnancy and childbirth.As of 2019, the effort has reached more than nine million women globally in 48 countries.The FDA approved BRAVECTO (fluralaner), the first chewable tablets for dogs to be shown to kill fleas and multiple tick species for 12 weeks in a single dose.The FDA approved KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), the first anti-PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy. It had previously received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA.From Guinea to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the world was dealing with the largest and most complex Ebola outbreaks since the virus was first discovered in 1976. As the outbreaks remained a global health challenge, scientists from Merck, along with numerous external collaborators from all sectors, remained at the forefront of the efforts to address this deadly disease.Merck received FDA approval for ERVEBO® (Ebola Zaire Vaccine, Live) for the prevention of disease caused by Zaire ebolavirus in individuals 18 years of age and older.Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG)Supporting society, people and communities around the world is fundamental to our long-term successOur leadership teamMeet the leaders who guide our purpose to use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world.Our culture and values It all comes back to saving and improving livesThis news release of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, N.J., USA (the “company”) includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

In 2001, Merck & Co., Inc. (Rahway, NJ, USA), which operates as MSD outside of the U.S. and Canada, established a Privacy Office to develop and oversee a global privacy program for our operations around the world. Our program is based on four privacy values that provide the foundation for responsible engagement, interactions and use of information about people:Our privacy program is built on a platform of organizational accountability for privacy, stewardship of the data we use to operate our business, consistent global privacy practices and standards that carry on our tradition of upholding high ethical standards across our business practices, and ongoing oversight to ensure that we continue to respond to changes in privacy expectations as technology and our business continue to evolve. For more information about our program, please see the global privacy program section of our corporate responsibility report.Since we believe that trust is a core privacy value and essential to our corporate mission to discover, develop and provide innovative products and services that save and improve lives around the world, our global privacy program strategy is centered on two primary goals that aim to drive trust in how we engage with people and how we access, use and transfer information about people around the world: Since we established our global privacy program in 2001, we have worked to implement and uphold consistent global privacy standards to provide assurance for how we manage our privacy and data protection obligations across countries and regions and to support our certifications under the following privacy frameworks recognized by regulators:Each of our certifications is based on our Cross Border Privacy Rules PolicyWe recognize that it can be difficult and overwhelming for people to understand all of the different ways that information about them can be observed, sensed, collected, shared, used, analyzed and transferred, so we use a variety of approaches to support our goal of making our practices transparent both to people about whom we process information as well as the regulators and their agents who review our practices.

Due to inconsistencies in preliminary test results of the active ingredient used in U.S. and Canadian products, Sanofi has made the decision to conduct the voluntary recall in Canada and the U.S. as the investigation continues.   Active ingredients used in Sanofi's ranitidine products outside Canada and the U.S. are sourced from different suppliers. Sanofi is committed to transparency and will continue to communicate results with health authorities from the ongoing testing, and work with them to make informed decisions based on available data and evidence.  Sanofi encourages anyone using Zantac OTC to speak with their health care providers or pharmacist if they have any additional questions.
